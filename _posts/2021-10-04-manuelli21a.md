title: 'Keypoints into the Future: Self-Supervised Correspondence in Model-Based Reinforcement
  Learning'
abstract: Predictive models have been at the core of many robotic systems, from quadrotors
  to walking robots. However, it has been challenging to develop and apply such models
  to practical robotic manipulation due to high-dimensional sensory observations such
  as images. Previous approaches to learning models in the context of robotic manipulation
  have either learned whole image dynamics or used autoencoders to learn dynamics
  in a low-dimensional latent state. In this work, we introduce model-based prediction
  with self-supervised visual correspondence learning, and show that not only is this
  indeed possible, but demonstrate that these types of predictive models show compelling
  performance improvements over alternative methods for vision-based RL with autoencoder-type
  vision training. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate that our models
  provide better generalization precision, particularly in 3D scenes, scenes involving
  occlusion, and in category-generalization. Additionally, we validate that our method
  effectively transfers to the real world through hardware experiments. https://sites.google.com/view/keypointsintothefuture
