title: 'ContactNets: Learning Discontinuous Contact Dynamics with Smooth, Implicit
  Representations'
abstract: Common methods for learning robot dynamics assume motion is continuous,
  causing unrealistic model predictions for systems undergoing discontinuous impact
  and stiction behavior. In this work, we resolve this conflict with a smooth, implicit
  encoding of the structure inherent to contact-induced discontinuities. Our method,
  ContactNets, learns parameterizations of inter-body signed distance and contact-frame
  Jacobians, a representation that is compatible with many simulation, control, and
  planning environments for robotics. We furthermore circumvent the need to differentiate
  through stiff or non-smooth dynamics with a novel loss function inspired by the
  principles of complementarity and maximum dissipation. Our method can predict realistic
  impact, non-penetration, and stiction when trained on 60 seconds of real-world data.
