title: 'SoftGym: Benchmarking Deep Reinforcement Learning for Deformable Object Manipulation'
abstract: Manipulating deformable objects has long been a challenge in robotics due
  to its high dimensional state representation and complex dynamics. Recent success
  in deep reinforcement learning provides a promising direction for learning to manipulate
  deformable objects with data driven methods. However, existing reinforcement learning
  benchmarks only cover tasks with direct state observability and simple low-dimensional
  dynamics or with relatively simple image-based environments, such as those with
  rigid objects. In this paper, we present SoftGym, a set of open-source simulated
  benchmarks for manipulating deformable objects, with a standard OpenAI Gym API and
  a Python interface for creating new environments. Our benchmark will enable reproducible
  research in this important area. Further, we evaluate a variety of algorithms on
  these tasks and highlight challenges for reinforcement learning algorithms, including
  dealing with a state representation that has a high intrinsic dimensionality and
  is partially observable. The experiments and analysis indicate the strengths and
  limitations of existing methods in the context of deformable object manipulation
  that can help point the way forward for future methods development.
