title: Learning Obstacle Representations for Neural Motion Planning
abstract: Motion planning and obstacle avoidance is a key challenge in robotics applications.
  While previous work succeeds to provide excellent solutions for known environments,
  sensor-based motion planning in new and dynamic environments remains to be  difficult.
  In this work we address sensor-based motion planning from a learning perspective.
  Motivated by recent advances in visual recognition, we argue the importance of learning
  appropriate representations for motion planning. We propose a new obstacle representation
  based on the PointNet architecture and learn it jointly with policies for obstacle
  avoidance. We experimentally evaluate our approach for rigid body motion planning
  in challenging environments and demonstrate significant improvements of the state
  of the art in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
