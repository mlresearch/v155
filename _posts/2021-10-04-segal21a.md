title: Universal Embeddings for Spatio-Temporal Tagging of Self-Driving Logs
abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of spatio-temporal tagging of self-driving
  scenes from raw sensor data. Our approach learns a universal embedding for all tags,
  enabling efficient tagging of many attributes and faster learning of new attributes
  with limited data. Importantly, the embedding is spatio-temporally aware, allowing
  the model to naturally output spatio-temporal tag values. Values can then be pooled
  over arbitrary regions, in order to, for example, compute the pedestrian density
  in front of the SDV, or determine if a car is blocking another car at a 4-way intersection.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a new large scale self-driving
  dataset, SDVScenes, containing 15 attributes relating to vehicle and pedestrian
  density, the actions of each actor, the speed of each actor, interactions between
  actors, and the topology of the road map.
