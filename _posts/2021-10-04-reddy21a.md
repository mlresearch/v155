title: 'Assisted Perception: Optimizing Observations to Communicate State'
abstract: 'We aim to help users estimate the state of the world in tasks like robotic
  teleoperation and navigation with visual impairment, where user may have systematic
  biases that lead to suboptimal behavior: they might struggle to process observations
  from multiple sensors simultaneously, receive delayed observations, or underestimate
  distances to obstacles. While we cannot directly change the user’s internal beliefs
  or their internal state estimation process, our insight is that we can still assist
  them by modifying the user’s observations. Instead of showing the user their true
  observations, ***we synthesize new observations that lead to more accurate internal
  state estimates when processed by the user***. We refer to this method as assistive
  state estimation (ASE): an automated assistant uses the true observations to infer
  the state of the world, then generates a modified observation for the user to consume
  (e.g., through an augmented reality interface), and optimizes the modification to
  induce the user’s new beliefs to match the assistant’s current beliefs. To predict
  the effect of the modified observation on the user’s beliefs, ASE learns a model
  of the user’s state estimation process: after each task completion, it searches
  for a model that would have led to beliefs that explain the user’s actions. We evaluate
  ASE in a user study with 12 participants who each perform four tasks: two tasks
  with known user biases – bandwidth-limited image classification and a driving video
  game with observation delay – and two with unknown biases that our method has to
  learn – guided 2D navigation and a lunar lander teleoperation video game. ASE’s
  general-purpose approach to synthesizing informative observations enables a different
  assistance strategy to emerge in each domain, such as quickly revealing informative
  pixels to speed up image classification, using a dynamics model to undo observation
  delay in driving, identifying nearby landmarks for navigation, and exaggerating
  a visual indicator of tilt in the lander game. The results show that ASE substantially
  improves the task performance of users with bandwidth constraints, observation delay,
  and other unknown biases.'
