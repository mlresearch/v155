title: Iterative Semi-parametric Dynamics Model Learning For Autonomous Racing
abstract: Accurately modeling robot dynamics is crucial to safe and efficient motion
  control. In this paper, we develop and apply an iterative learning semi-parametric
  model, with a neural network, to the task of autonomous racing with a Model Predictive  Controller
  (MPC). We present a novel non-linear semi-parametric dynamics model where we represent
  the known dynamics with a parametric model, and a neural network captures the unknown
  dynamics. We show that our model can learn more accurately than a purely parametric
  model and generalize better than a purely non-parametric model, making it ideal
  for real-world applications where collecting data from the full state space is not
  feasible. We present a system where the model is bootstrapped on pre-recorded data
  and then updated iteratively at run time. Then we apply our iterative learning approach
  to the simulated problem of autonomous racing and show that it can safely adapt
  to modified dynamics online and even achieve better performance than models trained
  on data from manual driving.
