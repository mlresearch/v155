title: 'Hardware as Policy: Mechanical and Computational Co-Optimization using Deep
  Reinforcement Learning'
abstract: 'Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great success in learning complex
  control policies for a variety of applications in robotics. However, in most such
  cases, the hardware of the robot has been considered immutable, modeled as part
  of the environment.  In this study, we explore the problem of learning hardware
  and control parameters together in a unified RL framework. To achieve this, we propose
  to model the robot body as a “hardware policy”, analogous to and optimized jointly
  with its computational counterpart. We show that, by modeling such hardware policies
  as auto-differentiable computational graphs, the ensuing optimization problem can
  be solved efficiently by gradient-based algorithms from the Policy Optimization
  family.  We present two such design examples:  a toy mass-spring problem, and a
  real-world problem of designing an underactuated hand.  We compare our method against
  traditional co-optimization approaches, and also demonstrate its effectiveness by
  building a physical prototype based on the learned hardware parameters.  Videos
