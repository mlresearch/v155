title: Recovering and Simulating Pedestrians in the Wild
abstract: Sensor simulation is a key component for testing the performance of self-driving
  vehicles and for data augmentation to better train perception systems. Typical approaches
  rely on artists to create both 3D assets and their animations to generate a new
  scenario. This, however, does not scale. In contrast, we propose to recover the
  shape and motion of pedestrians from sensor readings captured in the wild by a self-driving
  car driving around. Towards this goal, we formulate the problem as energy minimization
  in a deep structured model that exploits human shape priors, reprojection consistency
  with 2D poses extracted from images, and a ray-caster that encourages the reconstructed
  mesh to agree with the LiDAR readings. Importantly, we do not require any ground-truth
  3D scans or 3D pose annotations. We then incorporate the reconstructed pedestrian
  assets bank in a realistic LiDAR simulation system by performing motion retargeting,
  and show that the simulated LiDAR data can be used to significantly reduce the amount
  of annotated real-world data required for visual perception tasks.
