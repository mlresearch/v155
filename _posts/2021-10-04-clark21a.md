title: Learning Predictive Models for Ergonomic Control of Prosthetic Devices
abstract: 'We present Model-Predictive Interaction Primitives â€“ a robot learning framework
  for assistive motion in human-machine collaboration tasks which explicitly accounts
  for biomechanical impact on the human musculoskeletal system. First, we extend Interaction
  Primitives to enable predictive biomechanics: the prediction of future biomechanical
  states of a human partner conditioned on current observations and intended robot
  control signals. In turn, we leverage this capability within a model-predictive
  control strategy to identify the future ergonomic and biomechanical ramifications
  of potential robot actions. Optimal control trajectories are selected so as to minimize
  future physical impact on the human musculoskeletal system. We empirically demonstrate
  that our approach minimizes knee or muscle forces via generated control actions
  selected according to biomechanical cost functions. Experiments are performed in
  synthetic and real-world experiments involving powered prosthetic devices.'
