title: Self-Supervised Learning of Scene-Graph Representations for Robotic Sequential
  Manipulation Planning
abstract: We present a self-supervised representation learning approach for visual
  reasoning and integrate it into a nonlinear program formulation for motion optimization
  to tackle sequential manipulation tasks. Such problems have usually been addressed
  by combined task and motion planning approaches, for which spatial relations and
  logical rules that rely on symbolic representations have to be predefined by the
  user. We propose to learn relational structures by leveraging visual perception
  to alleviate the resulting knowledge acquisition bottleneck. In particular, we learn
  constructing {\em scene-graphs}, that represent objects (“red box"), and their spatial
  relationships (‘yellow cylinder on red box"). This representation allows us to plan
  high-level discrete decisions effectively using graph search algorithms. We integrate
  the visual reasoning module with a nonlinear optimization method for robot motion
  planning and verify its feasibility on the classic blocks-world domain. Our proposed
  framework successfully finds the sequence of actions and enables the robot to execute
  feasible motion plans to realize the given tasks.
