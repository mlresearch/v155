title: 'PLOP: Probabilistic Polynomial Objects trajectory Prediction for autonomous
  driving'
abstract: To navigate safely in urban environments, an autonomous vehicle (ego vehicle)
  must understand and anticipate its surroundings, in particular the behavior and
  intents of other road users (neighbors). Most of the times, multiple decision choices
  are acceptable for all road users (e.g., turn right or left, or different ways of
  avoiding an obstacle), leading to a highly uncertain and multi-modal decision space.
  We focus here on predicting multiple feasible future trajectories for both ego vehicle
  and neighbors through a probabilistic framework. We rely on a conditional imitation
  learning algorithm, conditioned by a navigation command for the ego vehicle (e.g.,
  “turn right”). Our model processes ego vehicle front-facing camera images and bird-eye
  view grid, computed from Lidar point clouds, with detections of past and present
  objects, in order to generate multiple trajectories for both ego vehicle and its
  neighbors. Our approach is computationally efficient and relies only on on-board
  sensors. We evaluate our method offline on the publicly available dataset nuScenes,
  achieving state-of-the-art performance, investigate the impact of our architecture
  choices on online simulated experiments and show preliminary insights for real vehicle
  control.
