title: 'MELD: Meta-Reinforcement Learning from Images via Latent State Models'
abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning algorithms can enable autonomous agents, such
  as robots, to quickly acquire new behaviors by leveraging prior experience in a
  set of related training tasks. However, the onerous data requirements of meta-training
  compounded with the challenge of learning from sensory inputs such as images have
  made meta-RL challenging to apply to real robotic systems. Latent state models,
  which learn compact state representations from a sequence of observations, can accelerate
  representation learning from visual inputs. In this paper, we leverage the perspective
  of meta-learning as task inference to show that latent state models can {\em also}
  perform meta-learning given an appropriately defined observation space. Building
  on this insight, we develop meta-RL with latent dynamics (MELD), an algorithm for
  meta-RL from images that performs inference in a latent state model to quickly acquire
  new skills given observations and rewards. MELD outperforms prior meta-RL methods
  on several simulated image-based robotic control problems, and enables a real WidowX
  robotic arm to insert an Ethernet cable into new locations given a sparse task completion
  signal after only $8$ hours of real world meta-training. To our knowledge, MELD
  is the first meta-RL algorithm trained in a real-world robotic control setting from
  images.
