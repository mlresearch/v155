title: Unsupervised Metric Relocalization Using Transform Consistency Loss
abstract: 'Training networks to perform metric relocalization traditionally requires
  accurate image correspondences. In practice, these are obtained by restricting domain
  coverage, employing additional sensors, or capturing large multi-view datasets.
  We instead propose a self-supervised solution, which exploits a key insight: localizing
  a query image within a map should yield the same absolute pose, regardless of the
  reference image used for registration. Guided by this intuition, we derive a novel
  transform consistency loss. Using this loss function, we train a deep neural network
  to infer dense feature and saliency maps to perform robust metric relocalization
  in dynamic environments.  We evaluate our framework on synthetic and real-world
  data, showing our approach outperforms other supervised methods when a limited amount
  of ground-truth information is available.'
