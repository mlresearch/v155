title: 'Robust Quadrupedal Locomotion on Sloped Terrains: A Linear Policy Approach'
abstract: In this paper, with a view toward fast deployment of locomotion gaits in
  low-cost hardware, we use a linear policy for realizing end-foot trajectories in
  the quadruped robot, Stoch 2. In particular, the parameters of the end-foot trajectories
  are shaped via a linear feedback policy that takes the torso orientation and the
  terrain slope as inputs. The corresponding desired joint angles are obtained via
  an inverse kinematics solver and tracked via a PID control law. Augmented Random
  Search, a model-free and a gradient-free learning algorithm is used to train this
  linear policy. Simulation results show that the resulting walking is robust to terrain
  slope variations and external pushes. This methodology is not only computationally
  light-weight but also uses minimal sensing and actuation capabilities in the robot,
  thereby justifying the approach.
