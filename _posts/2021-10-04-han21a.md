title: Planning Paths Through Unknown Space by Imagining What Lies Therein
abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for planning paths in maps containing
  unknown spaces, such as from occlusions. Our approach takes as input a semantically-annotated
  point cloud, and leverages an image inpainting neural network to generate a reasonable
  model of unknown space as free or occupied. Our validation campaign shows that it
  is possible to greatly increase the performance of standard pathfinding algorithms
  which adopt the general optimistic assumption of treating unknown space as free.
