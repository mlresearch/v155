title: Soft Multicopter Control Using Neural Dynamics Identification
abstract: 'We propose a data-driven method to automatically generate feedback controllers
  for soft multicopters featuring deformable materials, non-conventional geometries,
  and asymmetric rotor layouts, to deliver compliant deformation and agile locomotion.
  Our approach coordinates two sub-systems: a physics-inspired network ensemble that
  simulates the soft drone dynamics and a custom LQR control loop enhanced by a novel
  online-relinearization scheme to control the neural dynamics. Harnessing the insights
  from deformation mechanics, we design a decomposed state formulation whose modularity
  and compactness facilitate the dynamics learning while its measurability readies
  it for real-world adaptation. Our method is painless to implement, and requires
  only conventional, low-cost gadgets for fabrication. In a high-fidelity simulation
  environment, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by controlling a variety
  of customized soft multicopters to perform hovering, target reaching, velocity tracking,
  and active deformation.'
