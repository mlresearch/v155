title: Map-Adaptive Goal-Based Trajectory Prediction
abstract: We present a new method for multi-modal, long-term vehicle trajectory prediction.
  Our approach relies on using lane centerlines captured in rich maps of the environment
  to generate a set of proposed goal paths for each vehicle. Using these paths – which
  are generated at run time and therefore dynamically adapt to the scene – as spatial
  anchors, we predict a set of goal-based trajectories along with a categorical distribution
  over the goals. This approach allows us to directly model the goal-directed behavior
  of traffic actors, which unlocks the potential for more accurate long-term prediction.
  Our experimental results on both a large-scale internal driving dataset and on the
  public nuScenes dataset show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
  for vehicle trajectory prediction over a 6-second horizon. We also empirically demonstrate
  that our model is better able to generalize to road scenes from a completely new
  city than existing methods.
