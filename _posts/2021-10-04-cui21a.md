title: The EMPATHIC Framework for Task Learning from Implicit Human Feedback
abstract: Reactions such as gestures, facial expressions, and vocalizations are an
  abundant, naturally occurring channel of information that humans provide during
  interactions. A robot or other agent could leverage an understanding of such implicit
  human feedback to improve its task performance at no cost to the human. This approach
  contrasts with common agent teaching methods based on demonstrations, critiques,
  or other guidance that need to be attentively and intentionally provided. In this
  paper, we first define the general problem of learning from implicit human feedback
  and then propose to address this problem through a novel data-driven framework,
  EMPATHIC. This two-stage method consists of (1) mapping implicit human feedback
  to relevant task statistics such as reward, optimality, and advantage; and (2) using
  such a mapping to learn a task. We instantiate the first stage and three second-stage
  evaluations of the learned mapping. To do so, we collect a dataset of human facial
  reactions while subjects observe an agent execute a sub-optimal policy for a prescribed
  training task. We train a deep neural network on this data and demonstrate its ability
  to (1) infer relative reward ranking of events in the training task from prerecorded
  human facial reactions; (2) improve the policy of an agent in the training task
  using live human facial reactions; and (3) transfer to a novel domain in which it
  evaluates robot manipulation trajectories.
