title: Motion Planner Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Robot Manipulation in Obstructed
  Environments
abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents are able to learn contact-rich manipulation
  tasks by maximizing a reward signal, but require large amounts of experience, especially
  in environments with many obstacles that complicate exploration. In contrast, motion
  planners use explicit models of the agent and environment to plan collision-free
  paths to faraway goals, but suffer from inaccurate models in tasks that require
  contacts with the environment. To combine the benefits of both approaches, we propose
  motion planner augmented RL (MoPA-RL) which augments the action space of an RL agent
  with the long-horizon planning capabilities of motion planners. Based on the magnitude
  of the action, our approach smoothly transitions between directly executing the
  action and invoking a motion planner. We evaluate our approach on various simulated
  manipulation tasks and compare it to alternative action spaces in terms of learning
  efficiency and safety. The experiments demonstrate that MoPA-RL increases learning
  efficiency, leads to a faster exploration, and results in safer policies that avoid
  collisions with the environment. Videos and code are available at https://clvrai.com/mopa-rl.
