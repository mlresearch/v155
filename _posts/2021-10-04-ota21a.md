title: Deep Reactive Planning in Dynamic Environments
abstract: The main novelty of the proposed approach is that it allows a robot to learn
  an end-to-end policy which can adapt to changes in the environment during execution.
  While goal conditioning of policies has been studied in the RL literature, such
  approaches are not easily extended to settings where the robotâ€™s goal can change
  during execution. This is something that humans are naturally able to do. However,
  it is difficult for robots to learn such reflexes (i.e., to naturally respond to
  dynamic environments), especially when the goal location is not explicitly provided
  to the robot, and instead needs to be perceived through a vision sensor. In the
  current work, we present a method that can achieve such behavior by combining traditional
  kinematic planning, deep learning, and deep reinforcement learning in a synergistic
  fashion to generalize to arbitrary environments. We demonstrate the proposed approach
  for several reaching and pick-and-place tasks in simulation, as well as on a real
  system of a 6-DoF industrial manipulator.
