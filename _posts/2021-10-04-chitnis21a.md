title: 'CAMPs: Learning Context-Specific Abstractions for Efficient Planning in Factored
  MDPs'
abstract: 'Meta-planning, or learning to guide planning from experience, is a promising
  approach to improving the computational cost of planning. A general meta-planning
  strategy is to learn to impose constraints on the states considered and actions
  taken by the agent. We observe that (1) imposing a constraint can induce context-specific
  independences that render some aspects of the domain irrelevant, and (2) an agent
  can take advantage of this fact by imposing constraints on its own behavior. These
  observations lead us to propose the context-specific abstract Markov decision process
  (CAMP), an abstraction of a factored MDP that affords efficient planning. We then
  describe how to learn constraints to impose so the CAMP optimizes a trade-off between
  rewards and computational cost. Our experiments consider five planners across four
  domains, including robotic navigation among movable obstacles (NAMO), robotic task
  and motion planning for sequential manipulation, and classical planning. We find
  planning with learned CAMPs to consistently outperform baselines, including Stilmanâ€™s
  NAMO-specific algorithm. Video: https://youtu.be/wTXt6djcAd4 Code: https://git.io/JTnf6'
