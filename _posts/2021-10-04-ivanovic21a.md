title: 'MATS: An Interpretable Trajectory Forecasting Representation for Planning
  and Control'
abstract: Reasoning about human motion is a core component of modern human-robot interactive
  systems. In particular, one of the main uses of behavior prediction in autonomous
  systems is to inform robot motion planning and control. However, a majority of planning
  and control algorithms reason about system dynamics rather than the predicted agent
  tracklets (i.e., ordered sets of waypoints) that are commonly output by trajectory
  forecasting methods, which can hinder their integration. Towards this end, we propose
  Mixtures of Affine Time-varying Systems (MATS) as an output representation for trajectory
  forecasting that is more amenable to downstream planning and control use. Our approach
  leverages successful ideas from probabilistic trajectory forecasting works to learn
  dynamical system representations that are well-studied in the planning and control
  literature. We integrate our predictions with a proposed multimodal planning methodology
  and demonstrate significant computational efficiency improvements on a large-scale
  autonomous driving dataset.
