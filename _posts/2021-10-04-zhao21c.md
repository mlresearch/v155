title: Towards Robotic Assembly by Predicting Robust, Precise and Task-oriented Grasps
abstract: 'Robust task-oriented grasp planning is vital for autonomous robotic precision
  assembly tasks. Knowledge of the objectsâ€™ geometry and preconditions of the target
  task should be incorporated when determining the proper grasp to execute. However,
  several factors contribute to the challenges of realizing these grasps such as noise
  when controlling the robot, unknown object properties, and difficulties modeling
  complex object-object interactions. We propose a method that decomposes this problem
  and optimizes for grasp robustness, precision, and task performance by learning
  three cascaded networks. We evaluate our method in simulation on three common assembly
  tasks: inserting gears onto pegs, aligning brackets into corners, and inserting
  shapes into slots. Our policies are trained using a curriculum based on large-scale
  self-supervised grasp simulations with procedurally generated objects. Finally,
  we evaluate the performance of the first two tasks with a real robot where our method
  achieves 4.28mm error for bracket insertion and 1.44mm error for gear insertion.'
