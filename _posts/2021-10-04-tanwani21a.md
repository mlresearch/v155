title: 'DIRL: Domain-Invariant Representation Learning for Sim-to-Real Transfer'
abstract: 'Generating large-scale synthetic data in simulation is a feasible alternative
  to collecting/labelling real data for training vision-based deep learning models,
  albeit the modelling inaccuracies do not generalize to the physical world. In this
  paper, we present a domain-invariant representation learning (DIRL) algorithm to
  adapt deep models to the physical environment with a small amount of real data.
  Existing approaches that only mitigate the covariate shift by aligning the marginal
  distributions across the domains and assume the conditional distributions to be
  domain-invariant can lead to ambiguous transfer in real scenarios. We propose to
  jointly align the marginal (input domains) and the conditional (output labels) distributions
  to mitigate the covariate and the conditional shift across the domains with adversarial
  learning, and combine it with a triplet distribution loss to make the conditional
  distributions disjoint in the shared feature space. Experiments on digit domains
  yield state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks, while sim-to-real
  transfer of object recognition for vision-based decluttering with a mobile robot
  improves from $26.8 %$ to $91.0 %$, resulting in $86.5 %$ grasping accuracy of a
  wide variety of objects. Code and supplementary details are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/dirl'
