title: Learning to Walk in the Real World with Minimal Human Effort
abstract: 'Reliable and stable locomotion has been one of the most fundamental challenges
  for legged robots. Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) has emerged as a promising
  method for developing such control policies autonomously. In this paper, we develop
  a system for learning legged locomotion policies with deep RL in the real world
  with minimal human effort. The key difficulties for on-robot learning systems are
  automatic data collection and safety. We overcome these two challenges by developing
  a multi-task learning procedure and a safety-constrained RL framework. We tested
  our system on the task of learning to walk on three different terrains: flat ground,
  a soft mattress, and a doormat with crevices. Our system can automatically and efficiently
  learn locomotion skills on a Minitaur robot with little human intervention.'
