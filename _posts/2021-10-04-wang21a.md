title: 'CoT-AMFlow: Adaptive Modulation Network with Co-Teaching Strategy for Unsupervised
  Optical Flow Estimation'
abstract: The interpretation of ego motion and scene change is a fundamental task
  for mobile robots. Optical flow information can be employed to estimate motion in
  the surroundings. Recently, unsupervised optical flow estimation has become a research
  hotspot.  However, unsupervised approaches are often easy to be unreliable on partially
  occluded or texture-less regions. To deal with this problem, we propose CoT-AMFlow
  in this paper, an unsupervised optical flow estimation approach. In terms of the
  network architecture, we develop an adaptive modulation network that employs two
  novel module types, flow modulation modules (FMMs) and cost volume modulation modules
  (CMMs), to remove outliers in challenging regions. As for the training paradigm,
  we adopt a co-teaching strategy, where two networks simultaneously teach each other
  about challenging regions to further improve accuracy. Experimental results on the
  MPI Sintel, KITTI Flow and Middlebury Flow benchmarks demonstrate that our CoT-AMFlow
  outperforms all other state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, while still running
  in real time. Our project page is available at https://sites.google.com/view/cot-amflow.
