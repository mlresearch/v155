title: Learning Dexterous Manipulation from Suboptimal Experts
abstract: Learning dexterous manipulation in high-dimensional state-action spaces
  is an important open challenge with exploration presenting a major bottleneck. Although
  in many cases the learning process could be guided by demonstrations or other suboptimal
  experts, current RL algorithms for continuous action spaces often fail to effectively
  utilize combinations of highly off-policy expert data and on-policy exploration
  data. As a solution, we introduce Relative Entropy Q-Learning (REQ), a simple policy
  iteration algorithm that combines ideas from successful offline and conventional
  RL algorithms. It represents the optimal policy via importance sampling from a learned
  prior and is well-suited to take advantage of mixed data distributions. We demonstrate
  experimentally that REQ outperforms several strong baselines on robotic manipulation
  tasks for which suboptimal experts are available. We show how suboptimal experts
  can be constructed effectively by composing simple waypoint tracking controllers,
  and we also show how learned primitives can be combined with waypoint controllers
  to obtain reference behaviors to bootstrap a complex manipulation task on a simulated
  bimanual robot with human-like hands. Finally, we show that REQ is also effective
  for general off-policy RL, offline RL, and RL from demonstrations.
