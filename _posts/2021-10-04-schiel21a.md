title: Incremental learning of EMG-based control commands using Gaussian Processes
abstract: Myoelectric control is the process of controlling a prosthesis or an assistive
  robot by using electrical signals of the muscles. Pattern recognition in myoelectric
  control is a challenging field, since the underlying distribution of the signal
  is likely to change during the application. Covariate shifts, including changes
  of the arm position or different levels of muscular activation, often lead to significant
  instability of the control signal. This work tries to overcome these challenges
  by enhancing a myoelectric human machine interface through the use of the sparse
  Gaussian Process (sGP) approximation Variational Free Energy and by the introduction
  of a novel adaptive model based on an unsupervised incremental learning approach.
  The novel adaptive model integrates an interclass and intraclass distance to improve
  prediction stability under challenging conditions. Furthermore, it demonstrates
  the successful incorporation of incremental updates which is shown to lead to a
  significantly increased performance and higher  stability of the predictions in
  an online user study.
