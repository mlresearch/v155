title: Self-Supervised Object-in-Gripper Segmentation from Robotic Motions
abstract: Accurate object segmentation is a crucial task in the context of robotic
  manipulation. However, creating sufficient annotated training data for neural networks
  is particularly time consuming and often requires manual labeling. To this end,
  we propose a simple, yet robust solution for learning to segment unknown objects
  grasped by a robot. Specifically, we exploit motion and temporal cues in RGB video
  sequences. Using optical flow estimation we first learn to predict segmentation
  masks of our given manipulator. Then, these annotations are used in combination
  with motion cues to automatically distinguish between background, manipulator and
  unknown, grasped object. In contrast to existing systems our approach is fully self-supervised
  and independent of precise camera calibration, 3D models or potentially imperfect
  depth data. We perform a thorough comparison with alternative baselines and approaches
  from literature. The object masks and views are shown to be suitable training data
  for segmentation networks that generalize to novel environments and also allow for
  watertight 3D reconstruction.
