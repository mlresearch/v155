title: Learning Latent Representations to Influence Multi-Agent Interaction
abstract: Seamlessly interacting with humans or robots is hard because these agents
  are non-stationary. They update their policy in response to the ego agent’s behavior,
  and the ego agent must anticipate these changes to co-adapt. Inspired by humans,
  we recognize that robots do not need to explicitly model every low-level action
  another agent will make; instead, we can capture the latent strategy of other agents
  through high-level representations. We propose a reinforcement learning-based framework
  for learning latent representations of an agent’s policy, where the ego agent identifies
  the relationship between its behavior and the other agent’s future strategy. The
  ego agent then leverages these latent dynamics to influence the other agent, purposely
  guiding them towards policies suitable for co-adaptation. Across several simulated
  domains and a real-world air hockey game, our approach outperforms the alternatives
  and learns to influence the other agent.
