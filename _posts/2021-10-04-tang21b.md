title: Self-Supervised 3D Keypoint Learning for Ego-Motion Estimation
abstract: Detecting and matching robust viewpoint-invariant keypoints is critical
  for visual SLAM and Structure-from-Motion. State-of-the-art learning-based methods
  generate training samples via homography adaptation to create 2D synthetic views
  with known keypoint matches from a single image. This approach does not, however,
  generalize to non-planar 3D scenes with illumination variations commonly seen in
  real-world videos. In this work, we propose self-supervised learning depth-aware
  keypoints from unlabeled videos directly. We jointly learn keypoint and depth estimation
  networks by combining appearance and geometric matching via a differentiable structure-from-motion
  module based on Procrustean residual pose correction. We show how our self-supervised
  keypoints can be trivially incorporated into state-of-the-art visual odometry frameworks
  for robust and accurate ego-motion estimation of autonomous vehicles in real-world
  conditions.
