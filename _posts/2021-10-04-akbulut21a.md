title: 'ACNMP: Skill Transfer and Task Extrapolation through Learning from Demonstration
  and Reinforcement Learning via Representation Sharing'
abstract: To equip robots with dexterous skills, an effective approach is to first
  transfer the desired skill via Learning from Demonstration (LfD), then let the robot
  improve it by self-exploration via Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this paper, we
  propose a novel LfD+RL framework, namely Adaptive Conditional Neural Movement Primitives
  (ACNMP), that allows efficient policy improvement in novel environments and effective
  skill transfer between different agents. This is achieved through exploiting the
  latent representation learned by the underlying Conditional Neural Process (CNP)
  model, and simultaneous training of the model with supervised learning (SL) for
  acquiring the demonstrated trajectories and via RL for new trajectory discovery.
  Through simulation experiments, we show that (i) ACNMP enables the system to extrapolate
  to situations where pure LfD fails; (ii) Simultaneous training of the system through
  SL and RL  preserves the shape of demonstrations while adapting to novel situations
  due to the shared representations used by both learners; (iii) ACNMP enables order-of-magnitude
  sample-efficient RL in extrapolation of reaching tasks compared to the existing
  approaches; (iv) ACNMPs can be used to implement skill transfer between robots having
  different morphology, with competitive learning speeds and importantly with less
  number of assumptions compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, we show
  the real-world suitability of ACNMPs through real robot experiments that involve
  obstacle avoidance, pick and place and pouring actions.
