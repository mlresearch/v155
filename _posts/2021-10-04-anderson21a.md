title: Sim-to-Real Transfer for Vision-and-Language Navigation
abstract: We study the challenging problem of releasing a robot in a previously unseen
  environment, and having it follow unconstrained natural language navigation instructions.
  Recent work on the task of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) has achieved significant
  progress in simulation. To assess the implications of this work for robotics, we
  transfer a VLN agent trained in simulation to a physical robot. To bridge the gap
  between the high-level discrete action space learned by the VLN agent, and the robotâ€™s
  low-level continuous action space, we propose a subgoal model to identify nearby
  waypoints, and use domain randomization to mitigate visual domain differences. For
  accurate sim and real comparisons in parallel environments, we annotate a 325m2
  office space with 1.3km of navigation instructions, and create a digitized replica
  in simulation. We find that sim-to-real transfer to an environment not seen in training
  is successful if an occupancy map and navigation graph can be collected and annotated
  in advance (success rate of 46.8% vs. 55.9% in sim), but much more challenging in
  the hardest setting with no prior mapping at all (success rate of 22.5%).
