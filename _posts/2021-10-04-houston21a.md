title: 'One Thousand and One Hours: Self-driving Motion Prediction Dataset'
abstract: Motivated by the impact of large-scale datasets on ML systems we present
  the largest self-driving dataset for motion prediction to date, containing over
  1,000 hours of data. This was collected by a fleet of 20 autonomous vehicles along
  a fixed route in Palo Alto, California, over a four-month period. It consists of
  170,000 scenes, where each scene is 25 seconds long and captures the perception
  output of the self-driving system, which encodes the precise positions and motions
  of nearby vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians over time. On top of this, the dataset
  contains a high-definition semantic map with 15,242 labelled elements and a high-definition
  aerial view over the area. We show that using a dataset of this size dramatically
  improves performance for key self-driving problems. Combined with the provided software
  kit, this collection forms the largest and most detailed dataset to date for the
  development of self-driving machine learning tasks, such as motion forecasting,
  motion planning and simulation.
