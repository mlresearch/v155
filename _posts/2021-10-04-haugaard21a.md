title: Fast robust peg-in-hole insertion with continuous visual servoing
abstract: This paper demonstrates a visual servoing method which is robust towards
  uncertainties related to system calibration and grasping, while significantly reducing
  the peg-in-hole time compared to classical methods and recent attempts based on
  deep learning. The proposed visual servoing method is based on peg and hole point
  estimates from a deep neural network in a multi-cam setup, where the model is trained
  on purely synthetic data. Empirical results show that the learnt model generalizes
  to the real world, allowing for higher success rates and lower cycle times than
  existing approaches.
