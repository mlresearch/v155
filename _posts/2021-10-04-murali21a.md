title: 'Same Object, Different Grasps: Data and Semantic Knowledge for Task-Oriented
  Grasping'
abstract: Despite the enormous progress and generalization in robotic grasping in
  recent years, existing methods have yet to scale and generalize task-oriented grasping
  to the same extent. This is largely due to the scale of the datasets both in terms
  of the number of objects and tasks studied. We address these concerns with the TaskGrasp
  dataset which is more diverse both in terms of objects and tasks, and an order of
  magnitude larger than previous datasets. The dataset contains 250K task-oriented
  grasps for 56 tasks and 191 objects along with their RGB-D information. We take
  advantage of this new breadth and diversity in the data and present the GCNGrasp
  framework which uses the semantic knowledge of objects and tasks encoded in a knowledge
  graph to generalize to new object instances, classes and even new tasks. Our framework
  shows a significant improvement of around 12% on held-out settings compared to baseline
  methods which do not use semantics. We demonstrate that our dataset and model are
  applicable for the real world by executing task-oriented grasps on a real robot
  on unknown objects. Code, data and supplementary video could be found at https://github.com/adithyamurali/TaskGrasp.
