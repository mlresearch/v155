title: Multimodal Trajectory Prediction via Topological Invariance for Navigation
  at Uncontrolled Intersections
abstract: We focus on decentralized navigation among multiple non-communicating rational
  agents at {\em uncontrolled} intersections, i.e., street intersections without traffic
  signs or signals. Avoiding collisions in such domains relies on the ability of agents
  to predict each othersâ€™ intentions reliably, and react quickly. Multiagent trajectory
  prediction is NP-hard whereas the sample complexity of existing data-driven approaches
  limits their applicability. Our key insight is that the geometric structure of the
  intersection and the incentive of agents to move efficiently and avoid collisions
  (rationality) reduces the space of likely behaviors, effectively relaxing the problem
  of trajectory prediction. In this paper, we collapse the space of multiagent trajectories
  at an intersection into a set of modes representing different classes of multiagent
  behavior, formalized using a notion of topological invariance. Based on this formalism,
  we design Multiple Topologies Prediction (MTP), a data-driven trajectory-prediction
  mechanism that reconstructs trajectory representations of high-likelihood modes
  in multiagent intersection scenes. We show that MTP outperforms a state-of-the-art
  multimodal trajectory prediction baseline (MFP) in terms of prediction accuracy
  by 78.24% on a challenging simulated dataset. Finally, we show that MTP enables
  our optimization-based planner, MTPnav, to achieve collision-free and time-efficient
  navigation across a variety of challenging intersection scenarios on the CARLA simulator.
