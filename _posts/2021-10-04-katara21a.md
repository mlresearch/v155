title: 'DeepMPCVS: Deep Model Predictive Control for Visual Servoing'
abstract: The simplicity of the visual servoing approach makes it an attractive option
  for tasks dealing with vision-based control of robots in many real-world applications.
  However, attaining precise alignment for unseen environments pose a challenge to
  existing visual servoing approaches. While classical approaches assume a perfect
  world, the recent data-driven approaches face issues when generalizing to novel
  environments. In this paper, we aim to combine the best of both worlds. We present
  a deep model predictive visual servoing framework that can achieve precise alignment
  with optimal trajectories and can generalize to novel environments. Our framework
  consists of a deep network for optical flow predictions, which are used along with
  a predictive model to forecast future optical flow. For generating an optimal set
  of velocities we present a control network that can be trained on-the-fly without
  any supervision. Through extensive simulations on photo-realistic indoor settings
  of the popular Habitat framework, we show significant performance gain due to the
  proposed formulation vis-a-vis recent state of the art methods. Specifically, we
  show vastly improved performance in trajectory length and faster convergence over
  recent approaches.
