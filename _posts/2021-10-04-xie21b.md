title: 'MuGNet: Multi-Resolution Graph Neural Network for Segmenting Large-Scale Pointclouds'
abstract: In this paper, we propose a multi-resolution deep-learning architecture
  to segment dense large-scale pointclouds semantically. Dense pointcloud data require
  a computationally expensive feature encoding process before semantic segmentation.
  Previous work has used different approaches to drastically downsample from the original
  pointcloud to utilize common computing hardware. While these approaches can relieve
  the computation burden to some extent, they are still limited in their processing
  capability for multiple scans. We present MuGNet, a memory-efficient, end-to-end
  graph neural network framework to perform semantic segmentation on large-scale pointclouds.
  We reduce the computation demand by utilizing a graph neural network on the preformed
  pointcloud graphs and retain the segmentationâ€™s precision with a bidirectional network
  that fuses feature embedding at different resolutions. Our framework has been validated
  on benchmark datasets, including Stanford Large-Scale 3D Indoor Spaces Dataset(S3DIS)
  and Virtual KITTI Dataset. We demonstrate that our framework can process up to 45
  room scans at once on a single 11 GB GPU while still surpassing other graph-based
  solutions for segmentation on S3DIS with an 88.5% (+3%) overall accuracy and 69.8%
  (+7.7%) mIOU accuracy.
