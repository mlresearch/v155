title: High Acceleration Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Juggling with Binary
  Rewards
abstract: Robots that can learn in the physical world will be important to enable
  robots to escape their stiff and pre-programmed movements.  For dynamic high-acceleration
  tasks, such as juggling, learning in the real-world is particularly challenging  as  one  must  push  the  limits  of  the  robot  and  its  actuation  without
  harming the system, amplifying the necessity of sample efficiency and safety for
  robot learning algorithms.  In contrast to prior work which mainly focuses on the
  learning algorithm, we propose a learning system, that directly incorporates these
  requirements in the design of the policy representation,  initialization,  and optimization.  We
  demonstrate that this system enables the high-speed Barrett WAM manipulator to learn
  juggling two balls from 56 minutes of experience with a binary reward signal and
  finally juggles continuously for up to 33 minutes or about 4500 repeated catches.
