title: A User’s Guide to Calibrating Robotic Simulators
abstract: Simulators are a critical component of modern robotics research. Strategies
  for both perception and decision making can be studied in simulation first, before
  deployed to real world systems, saving on time and costs. Despite significant progress
  on the development of sim-to-real algorithms, the analysis of  different methods
  is still conducted in an ad-hoc manner without a consistent set of tests and metrics
  for comparison. This paper intends to fill this gap and proposes a set of benchmarks
  and a framework for the study of various algorithms aimed to transfer models and
  policies learnt in simulation to the real world. We conduct experiments on a wide
  range of well known simulated environments to characterise and offer insights into
  the performance of different algorithms. Our analysis can be useful for practitioners
  working in this area and can help make informed choices about the behaviour and
  main properties of sim-to-real algorithms.
