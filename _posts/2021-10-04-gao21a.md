title: Attentional Separation-and-Aggregation Network for Self-supervised Depth-Pose
  Learning in Dynamic Scenes
abstract: Learning depth and ego-motion from unlabeled videos via self-supervision
  from epipolar projection can improve the robustness and accuracy of the 3D perception
  and localization of vision-based robots. However, the rigid projection computed
  by ego-motion cannot represent all scene points, such as points on moving objects,
  leading to false guidance in these regions. To address this problem, we propose
  an Attentional Separation-and-Aggregation Network (ASANet), which can learn to distinguish
  and extract the scene’s static and dynamic characteristics via the attention mechanism.
  We further propose a novel MotionNet with an ASANet as the encoder, followed by
  two separate decoders, to estimate the camera’s ego-motion and the scene’s dynamic
  motion field. Then, we introduce an auto-selecting approach to detect the moving
  objects for dynamic-aware learning automatically. Empirical experiments demonstrate
  that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark.
