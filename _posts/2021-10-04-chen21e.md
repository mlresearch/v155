title: Reactive motion planning with probabilisticsafety guarantees
abstract: Motion planning in environments with multiple agents is critical to many
  important autonomous applications such as autonomous vehicles and assistive robots.
  This paper considers the problem of motion planning, where the controlled agent
  shares the environment with multiple uncontrolled agents. First, a predictive model
  of the uncontrolled agents is trained to predict all possible trajectories within
  a short horizon based on the scenario. The prediction is then fed to a motion planning
  module based on model predictive control. We proved generalization bound for the
  predictive model using three different methods, post-bloating, support vector machine
  (SVM), and conformal analysis, all capable of generating stochastic guarantees of
  the correctness of the predictor. The proposed approach is demonstrated in simulation
  in a scenario emulating autonomous highway driving.
