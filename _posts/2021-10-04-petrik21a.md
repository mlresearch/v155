title: Learning Object Manipulation Skills via Approximate State Estimation from Real
  Videos
abstract: Humans are adept at learning new tasks by watching a few instructional videos.
  On the other hand, robots that learn new actions either require a lot of effort
  through trial and error, or use expert demonstrations that are challenging to obtain.
  In this paper, we explore a method that facilitates learning object manipulation
  skills directly from videos. Leveraging recent advances in 2D visual recognition
  and differentiable rendering, we develop an optimization based method to estimate
  a coarse 3D state representation for the hand and the manipulated object(s) without
  requiring any supervision. We use these trajectories as dense rewards for an agent
  that learns to mimic them through reinforcement learning. We evaluate our method
  on simple single- and two-object actions from the Something-Something dataset. Our
  approach allows an agent to learn actions from single videos, while watching multiple
  demonstrations makes the policy more robust. We show that policies learned in a
  simulated environment can be easily transferred to a real robot.
