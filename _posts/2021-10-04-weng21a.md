title: 'Inverting the Pose Forecasting Pipeline with SPF2: Sequential Pointcloud Forecasting
  for Sequential Pose Forecasting'
abstract: Many autonomous systems forecast aspects of the future in order to aid decision-making.
  For example, self-driving vehicles and robotic manipulation systems often forecast
  future object poses by first detecting and tracking objects. However, this detect-then-forecast
  pipeline is expensive to scale, as pose forecasting algorithms typically require
  labeled sequences of object poses, which are costly to obtain in 3D space. Can we
  scale performance without requiring additional labels? We hypothesize yes, and propose
  inverting the detect-then-forecast pipeline. Instead of detecting, tracking and
  then forecasting the objects, we propose to first forecast 3D sensor data (e.g.,
  point clouds with $100$k points) and then detect/track objects on the predicted
  point cloud sequences to obtain future poses, i.e., a forecast-then-detect pipeline.
  This inversion makes it less expensive to scale pose forecasting, as the sensor
  data forecasting task requires no labels. Part of this work’s focus is on the challenging
  first step – Sequential Pointcloud Forecasting (SPF), for which we also propose
  an effective approach, SPFNet. To compare our forecast-then-detect pipeline relative
  to the detect-then-forecast pipeline, we propose an evaluation procedure and two
  metrics. Through experiments on a robotic manipulation dataset and two driving datasets,
  we show that SPFNet is effective for the SPF task, our forecast-then-detect pipeline
  outperforms the detect-then-forecast approaches to which we compared, and that pose
  forecasting performance improves with the addition of unlabeled data. Our project
