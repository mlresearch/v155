title: Learning a natural-language to LTL executable semantic parser for grounded
  robotics
abstract: 'Children acquire their native language with apparent ease by observing
  how language is used in context and attempting to use it themselves. They do so
  without laborious annotations, negative examples, or even direct corrections. We
  take a step toward robots that can do the same by training a grounded semantic parser,
  which discovers latent linguistic representations that can be used for the execution
  of  natural-language commands. In particular, we focus on the difficult domain of
  commands with a temporal aspect, whose semantics we capture with Linear Temporal
  Logic, LTL. Our parser is trained with pairs of sentences and executions as well
  as an executor. At training time, the parser hypothesizes a meaning representation
  for the input as a formula in LTL. Three competing pressures allow the parser to
  discover  meaning from language. First, any hypothesized meaning for a sentence
  must be permissive enough to reflect all the annotated execution trajectories. Second,
  the executor — a pretrained end-to-end LTL planner — must find that the observed
  trajectories are  likely executions of the meaning. Finally, a generator, which
  reconstructs the original input, encourages the model to find representations that
  conserve knowledge about the command. Together these ensure that the meaning is
  neither too general nor too specific. Our model generalizes well, being able to
  parse and execute both machine-generated and human-generated commands, with near-equal
  accuracy, despite the fact that the human-generated sentences are much more varied
  and complex with an open lexicon. The approach presented here is not specific to
  LTL: it can be applied to any domain where sentence meanings can be hypothesized
  and  an executor can verify these meanings, thus opening the door to many applications
  for robotic agents.'
