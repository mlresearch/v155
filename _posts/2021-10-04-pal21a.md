title: Learning hierarchical relationships for object-goal navigation
abstract: Direct search for objects as part of navigation poses a challenge for small
  items. Utilizing context in the form of object-object relationships enable hierarchical
  search for targets efficiently. Most of the current approaches tend to directly
  incorporate sensory input into a reward-based learning approach, without learning
  about object relationships in the natural environment, and thus generalize poorly
  across domains. We present Memory-utilized Joint hierarchical Object Learning for
  Navigation in Indoor Rooms (MJOLNIR), a target-driven navigation algorithm, which
  considers the inherent relationship between target objects, and the more salient
  contextual objects occurring in its surrounding. Extensive experiments conducted
  across multiple environment settings show an 82.9% and 93.5% gain over existing
  state-of-the-art navigation methods in terms of the success rate (SR), and success
  weighted by path length (SPL), respectively. We also show that our model learns
  to converge much faster than other algorithms, without suffering from the well-known
  overfitting problem. Additional details regarding the supplementary material and
