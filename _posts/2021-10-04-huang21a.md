title: Learning a Decision Module by Imitating Driver’s Control Behaviors
abstract: Autonomous driving systems have a pipeline of perception, decision, planning,
  and control. The decision module processes information from the perception module
  and directs the execution of downstream planning and control modules. On the other
  hand, the recent success of deep learning suggests that this pipeline could be replaced
  by end-to-end neural control policies, however, safety cannot be well guaranteed
  for the data-driven neural networks. In this work, we propose a hybrid framework
  to learn neural decisions in the classical modular pipeline through end-to-end imitation
  learning.  This hybrid framework can preserve the merits of the classical pipeline
  such as the strict enforcement of physical and logical constraints while learning
  complex driving decisions from data. To circumvent the ambiguous annotation of human
  driving decisions, our method learns high-level driving decisions by imitating low-level
  control behaviors. We show in the simulation experiments that our modular driving
  agent can generalize its driving decision and control to various complex scenarios
  where the rule-based programs fail. It can also generate smoother and safer driving
  trajectories than end-to-end neural policies. Demo and code are available at https://decisionforce.github.io/modulardecision/.
