title: Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Multiagent Rendezvous
abstract: Collaboration requires agents to align their goals on the fly. Underlying
  the human ability to align goals with other agents is their ability to predict the
  intentions of others and actively update their own plans. We propose hierarchical
  predictive planning (HPP), a model-based reinforcement learning method for decentralized
  multiagent rendezvous. Starting with pretrained, single-agent point to point navigation
  policies  and using noisy, high-dimensional sensor inputs like lidar, we first learn
  via self-supervision motion predictions of all agents on the team. Next, HPP uses
  the prediction models to propose and evaluate navigation subgoals for completing
  the rendezvous task without explicit communication among agents. We evaluate HPP
  in a suite of unseen environments, with increasing complexity and numbers of obstacles.
  We show that HPP outperforms alternative reinforcement learning, path planning,
  and heuristic-based baselines on challenging, unseen environments. Experiments in
  the real world demonstrate successful transfer of the prediction models from sim
  to real world without any additional fine-tuning. Altogether, HPP removes the need
  for a centralized operator in multiagent systems by combining model-based RL and
  inference methods, enabling agents to dynamically align plans.
