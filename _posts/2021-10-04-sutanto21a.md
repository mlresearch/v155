title: Learning Equality Constraints for Motion Planning on Manifolds
abstract: Constrained robot motion planning is a widely used technique to solve complex
  robot tasks. We consider the problem of learning representations of constraints
  from demonstrations with a deep neural network, which we call Equality Constraint
  Manifold Neural Network (ECoMaNN). The key idea is to learn a level-set function
  of the constraint suitable for integration into a constrained sampling-based motion
  planner. Learning proceeds by aligning subspaces in the network with subspaces of
  the data. We combine both learned constraints and analytically described constraints
  into the planner and use a projection-based strategy to find valid points. We evaluate
  ECoMaNN on its representation capabilities of constraint manifolds, the impact of
  its individual loss terms, and the motions produced when incorporated into a planner.
