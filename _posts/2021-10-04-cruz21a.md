title: Generation of Realistic Images for Learning in Simulation using FeatureGAN
abstract: 'This paper presents FeatureGan, a methodology to train image translators
  (generators) using an unpaired image training set. FeatureGan is based on the use
  of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and has three main novel components: (i)
  the use of a feature loss to ensure alignment between the input and the generated
  image, (ii) the use of a feature pyramid discriminator, which uses a tensor composed
  of features at different levels of abstraction generated by a pre-trained network,
  and (iii) the introduction of a per class loss to improve the results in the simulation-to-reality
  task. The main advantage of the proposed methodology when compared to classical
  approaches is a more stable training process, which includes a higher resilience
  to common GAN problems such as mode collapse, as well as better and more consistent
  results. FeatureGan is also fast to train, easy to replicate, and especially suited
  to be used in simulation-to-reality applications where the generated realistic images
  allow to close the visual simulation-to-reality gap. As a proof of concept, we show
  the application of the proposed methodology in soccer robotics, where realistic
  images are generated in a soccer robotics simulator, and robot and ball detectors
  are trained using these images and then tested in reality. The same methodology
  is used to generate realistic images from images rendered in a video game. The realistic
  images are then used to train a semantic segmentation network.'
