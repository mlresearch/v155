title: 'IV-SLAM: Introspective Vision for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping'
abstract: Existing solutions to visual simultaneous localization and mapping (V-SLAM)
  assume that errors in feature extraction and matching are independent and identically
  distributed (i.i.d), but this assumption is known to not be true â€“ features extracted
  from low-contrast regions of images exhibit wider error distributions than features
  from sharp corners. Furthermore, V-SLAM algorithms are prone to catastrophic tracking
  failures when sensed images include challenging conditions such as specular reflections,
  lens flare, or shadows of dynamic objects. To address such failures, previous work
  has focused on building more robust visual frontends, to filter out challenging
  features. In this paper, we present introspective vision for SLAM (IV-SLAM), a fundamentally
  different approach for addressing these challenges. IV-SLAM explicitly models the
  noise process of reprojection errors from visual features to be context-dependent,
  and hence non-i.i.d. We introduce an autonomously supervised approach for IV-SLAM
  to collect training data to learn such a context-aware noise model. Using this learned
  noise model, IV-SLAM guides feature extraction to select more features from parts
  of the image that are likely to result in lower noise, and further incorporate the
  learned noise model into the joint maximum likelihood estimation, thus making it
  robust to the aforementioned types of errors. We present empirical results to demonstrate
  that IV-SLAM 1) is able to accurately predict sources of error in input images,
  2) reduces tracking error compared to V-SLAM, and 3) increases the mean distance
  between tracking failures by more than 70% on challenging real robot data compared
  to V-SLAM.
