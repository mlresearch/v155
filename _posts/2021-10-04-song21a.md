title: 'Flightmare: A Flexible Quadrotor Simulator'
abstract: 'State-of-the-art quadrotor simulators have a rigid and highly-specialized
  structure: either are they really fast, physically accurate, or photo-realistic.
  In this work, we propose a paradigm shift in the development of simulators: moving
  the trade-off between accuracy and speed from the developers to the end-users. We
  use this idea to develop a flexible quadrotor simulator: Flightmare. In this work,
  we propose a novel quadrotor simulator: Flightmare.  Flightmare is composed of two
  main components: a configurable rendering engine built on Unity and a flexible physics
  engine for dynamics simulation. Those two components are totally decoupled and can
  run independently of each other. This makes our simulator extremely fast: rendering
  achieves speeds of up to 230 Hz, while physics simulation of up to 200,000 Hz on
  a laptop. In addition, Flightmare comes with several desirable features: (i) a large
  multi-modal sensor suite, including an interface to extract the 3D point-cloud of
  the scene; (ii) an API for reinforcement learning which can simulate hundreds of
  quadrotors in parallel; and (iii) integration with a virtual-reality headset for
  interaction with the simulated environment. We demonstrate the flexibility of Flightmare
  by using it for two different robotic tasks: quadrotor control using deep reinforcement
  learning and collision-free path planning in a complex 3D environment.'
