title: Contrastive Variational Reinforcement Learning for Complex Observations
abstract: 'Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved significant success in various
  robot tasks: manipulation, navigation, etc. However, complex visual observations
  in natural environments remains a major challenge. This paper presents Contrastive
  Variational Reinforcement Learning (CVRL), a model-based method that tackles complex
  visual observations in  DRL.  CVRL learns a contrastive variational model by maximizing
  the mutual information between latent states and observations discriminatively,
  through contrastive learning. It avoids modeling the complex observation space unnecessarily,
  as the commonly used generative observation model often does,  and is significantly
  more robust. CVRL achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art model-based
  DRL methods on standard Mujoco tasks. It significantly outperforms them on Natural
  Mujoco tasks and a robot box-pushing task with complex observations, e.g., dynamic
  shadows. The CVRL code is available publicly at https://github.com/Yusufma03/CVRL.'
