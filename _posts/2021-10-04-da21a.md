title: Learning a Contact-Adaptive Controller for Robust, Efficient Legged Locomotion
abstract: We present a hierarchical framework that combines model-based control and
  reinforcement learning (RL) to synthesize robust controllers for a quadruped (the
  Unitree Laikago). The system consists of a high-level controller that learns to
  choose from a set of primitives in response to changes in the environment and a
  low-level controller that utilizes an established control method to robustly execute
  the primitives. Our framework learns a controller that can adapt to challenging
  environmental changes on the fly, including novel scenarios not seen during training.
  The learned controller is up to 85Â percent more energy efficient and is more robust
  compared to baseline methods. We also deploy the controller on a physical robot
  without any randomization or adaptation scheme.
