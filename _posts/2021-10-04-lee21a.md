title: Learning Arbitrary-Goal Fabric Folding with One Hour of Real Robot Experience
abstract: Manipulating deformable objects, such as fabric, is a long standing problem
  in robotics, with state estimation and control posing a significant challenge for
  traditional methods. In this paper, we show that it is possible to learn fabric
  folding skills in only an hour of self-supervised real robot experience, without
  human supervision or simulation. Our approach relies on fully convolutional networks
  and the manipulation of visual inputs to exploit learned features, allowing us to
  create an expressive goal-conditioned pick and place policy that can be trained
  efficiently with real world robot data only. Folding skills are learned with only
  a sparse reward function and thus do not require reward function engineering, merely
  an image of the goal configuration. We demonstrate our method on a set of towel-folding
  tasks, and show that our approach is able to discover sequential folding strategies,
  purely from trial-and-error. We achieve state-of-the-art results without the need
  for demonstrations or simulation, used in prior approaches.
