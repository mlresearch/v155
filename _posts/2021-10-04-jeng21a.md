title: 'GDN: A Coarse-To-Fine (C2F) Representation for End-To-End 6-DoF Grasp Detection'
abstract: We proposed an end-to-end grasp detection network,  Grasp Detection Network
  (GDN), cooperated with a novel coarse-to-fine (C2F) grasp representation design
  to detect diverse and accurate 6-DoF grasps based on point clouds.   Compared to
  previous two-stage approaches which sample and evaluate multiple grasp candidates,
  our architecture is at least 20 times faster.  It is also 8% and 40% more accurate
  in terms of the success rate in single object scenes and the complete rate in clutter
  scenes, respectively. Our method shows superior results among settings with different
  number of views and input points.  Moreover, we propose a new AP-based metric which
  considers both rotation and transition errors, making it a more comprehensive evaluation
  tool for grasp detection models.
