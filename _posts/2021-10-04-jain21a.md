title: 'From pixels to legs: Hierarchical learning of quadruped locomotion'
abstract: 'Legged robots navigating crowded scenes and complex terrains in the real
  world are required to execute dynamic leg movements while processing visual input
  for obstacle avoidance and path planning. We show that a quadruped robot can acquire
  both of these skills by means of hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). By virtue
  of their hierarchical structure, our policies learn to implicitly break down this
  joint problem by concurrently learning High Level (HL) and Low Level (LL) neural
  network policies. These two levels are connected by a low dimensional hidden layer,
  which we call latent command. HL receives a first-person camera view, whereas LL
  receives the latent command from HL and the robotâ€™s on-board sensors to control
  its actuators. We train policies to walk in two different environments: a curved
  cliff and a maze. We show that hierarchical policies can concurrently learn to locomote
  and navigate in these environments, and show they are more efficient than non-hierarchical
  neural network policies. This architecture also allows for knowledge reuse across
  tasks. LL networks trained on one task can be transferred to a new task in a new
  environment. Finally HL, which processes camera images, can be evaluated at much
  lower and varying frequencies compared to LL, thus reducing computation times and
  bandwidth requirements.'
