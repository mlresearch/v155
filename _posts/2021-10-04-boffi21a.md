title: Learning Stability Certificates from Data
abstract: Many existing tools in nonlinear control theory for establishing stability
  or safety of a dynamical system can be distilled to the construction of a certificate
  function which guarantees a desired property. However, algorithms for synthesizing
  certificate functions typically require a closed-form analytical expression of the
  underlying dynamics, which rules out their use on many modern robotic platforms.
  To circumvent this issue, we develop algorithms for learning certificate functions
  only from trajectory data. We establish bounds on the generalization error – the
  probability that a certificate will not certify a new, unseen trajectory – when
  learning from trajectories, and we convert such generalization error bounds into
  global stability guarantees. We demonstrate empirically that certificates for complex
  dynamics can be efficiently learned, and that the learned certificates can be used
  for downstream tasks such as adaptive control.
