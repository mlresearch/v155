title: Towards Autonomous Eye Surgery by Combining Deep Imitation Learning with Optimal
  Control
abstract: 'During retinal microsurgery, precise manipulation of the delicate retinal
  tissue is required for positive surgical outcome. However, accurate manipulation
  and navigation of surgical tools remain difficult due to a constrained workspace
  and the top-down view during the surgery, which limits the surgeon’s ability to
  estimate depth. To alleviate such difficulty, we propose to automate the tool-navigation
  task by learning to predict relative goal position on the retinal surface from the
  current tool-tip position. Given an estimated target on the retina, we generate
  an optimal trajectory leading to the predicted goal while imposing safety-related
  physical constraints aimed to minimize tissue damage. As an extended task, we generate
  goal predictions to various points across the retina to localize eye geometry and
  further generate safe trajectories within the estimated confines. Through experiments
  in both simulation and with several eye phantoms, we demonstrate that our framework
  can permit navigation to various points on the retina within 0.089mm and 0.118mm
  in xy error which is less than the human’s surgeon mean tremor at the tool-tip of
  0.180mm. All safety constraints were fulfilled and the algorithm was robust to previously
  unseen eyes as well as unseen objects in the scene. Live video demonstration is
