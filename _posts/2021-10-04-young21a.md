title: Visual Imitation Made Easy
abstract: 'Visual imitation learning provides a framework for learning complex manipulation
  behaviors by leveraging human demonstrations. However, current interfaces for imitation
  such as kinesthetic teaching or teleoperation prohibitively restrict our ability
  to efficiently collect large-scale data in the wild. Obtaining such diverse demonstration
  data is paramount for the generalization of learned skills to novel scenarios. In
  this work, we present an alternate interface for imitation that simplifies the data
  collection process while allowing for easy transfer to robots. We use commercially
  available reacher-grabber assistive tools both as a data collection device and as
  the robotâ€™s end-effector. To extract action information from these visual demonstrations,
  we use off-the-shelf Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques in addition to training
  a finger detection network. We experimentally evaluate on two challenging tasks:
  non-prehensile pushing and prehensile stacking, with 1000 diverse demonstrations
  for each task. For both tasks, we use standard behavior cloning to learn executable
  policies from the previously collected offline demonstrations. To improve learning
  performance, we employ a variety of data augmentations and provide an extensive
  analysis of its effects. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our interface by
  evaluating on real robotic scenarios with previously unseen objects and achieve
  a 87% success rate on pushing and a 62% success rate on stacking. Robot videos are
