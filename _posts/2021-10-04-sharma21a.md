title: Learning to Compose Hierarchical Object-Centric Controllers for Robotic Manipulation
abstract: Manipulation tasks can often be decomposed into multiple subtasks performed
  in parallel, e.g., sliding an object to a goal pose while maintaining contact with
  a table.  Individual subtasks can be achieved by task-axis controllers defined relative
  to the objects being manipulated, and a set of object-centric controllers can be
  combined in an hierarchy. In prior works, such combinations are defined manually
  or learned from demonstrations. By contrast, we propose using reinforcement learning
  to dynamically compose hierarchical object-centric controllers for manipulation
  tasks. Experiments in both simulation and real world show how the proposed approach
  leads to improved sample efficiency, zero-shot generalization to novel test environments,
  and simulation-to-reality transfer without fine-tuning.
