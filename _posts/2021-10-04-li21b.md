title: Differentiable Logic Layer for Rule Guided Trajectory Prediction
abstract: In this work, we propose a method for integration of temporal logic formulas
  into a neural network. Our main contribution is a new logic optimization layer that
  uses differentiable optimization on the formulasâ€™ robustness function. This allows
  incorporating traffic rules into deep learning based trajectory prediction approaches.
  In the forward pass, an initial prediction from a base predictor is used to initialize
  and guide the robustness optimization process. Backpropagation through the logic
  layer allows for simultaneously adjusting the parameters of the rules and the initial
  prediction network. The integration of a logic layer affords both improved predictions,
  as well as quantification rule satisfaction and violation during predictor execution.
  As such, it can serve as a parametric safety- envelope for black box behavior models.
  We demonstrate how integrating traffic rules improves the predictor performance
  using real traffic data from the NuScenes dataset.
