title: Untangling Dense Knots by Learning Task-Relevant Keypoints
abstract: 'Untangling ropes, wires, and cables is a challenging task for robots due
  to the high-dimensional configuration space, visual homogeneity, self-occlusions,
  and complex dynamics. We consider dense (tight) knots that lack space between self-intersections
  and present an iterative approach that uses learned geometric structure in configurations.
  We instantiate this into an algorithm, HULK: Hierarchical Untangling from Learned
  Keypoints, which combines learning-based perception with a geometric planner into
  a policy that guides a bilateral robot to untangle knots. To evaluate the policy,
  we perform experiments both in a novel simulation environment modelling cables with
  varied knot types and textures and in a physical system using the da Vinci surgical
  robot. We find that HULK is able to untangle cables with dense figure-eight and
  overhand knots and generalize to varied textures and appearances. We compare two
  variants of HULK to three baselines and observe that HULK achieves 43.3% higher
  success rates on a physical system compared to the next best baseline. HULK successfully
  untangles a cable from a dense initial configuration containing up to two overhand
  and figure-eight knots in 97.9% of 378 simulation experiments with an average of
  12.1 actions per trial. In physical experiments, HULK achieves 61.7% untangling
  success, averaging 8.48 actions per trial. Supplementary material, code, and videos
