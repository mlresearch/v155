title: Learning from Demonstrations using Signal Temporal Logic
abstract: Learning-from-demonstrations is an emerging paradigm to obtain effective
  robot control policies for complex tasks via reinforcement learning without the
  need to explicitly design reward functions. However, it is susceptible to imperfections
  in demonstrations and also raises concerns of safety and interpretability in the
  learned control policies. To address these issues, we use Signal Temporal Logic
  to evaluate and rank the quality of demonstrations. Temporal logic-based specifications
  allow us to create non-Markovian rewards, and also define interesting causal dependencies
  between tasks such as sequential task specifications. We validate our approach through
  experiments on discrete-world and OpenAI Gym environments, and show that our approach
  outperforms the state-of-the-art Maximum Causal Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning.
