title: Learning Interactively to Resolve Ambiguity in Reference Frame Selection
abstract: In Learning from Demonstrations, ambiguities can lead to bad generalization
  of the learned policy. This paper proposes a framework called Learning Interactively
  to Resolve Ambiguity (LIRA), that recognizes ambiguous situations, in which more
  than one action have similar probabilities, avoids a random action selection, and
  uses the human feedback for solving them. The aim is to improve the user experience,
  the learning performance and safety. LIRA is tested in the selection of the right
  goal of Movement Primitives (MP) out of a candidate list if multiple contradictory
  generalizations of the demonstration(s) are possible. The framework is validated
  on different pick and place operations on a Emika-Franka Robot. A user study showed
  a significant reduction on the task load of the user, compared to a system that
  does not allow interactive resolution of ambiguities.
