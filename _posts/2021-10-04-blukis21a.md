title: Few-shot Object Grounding and Mapping for Natural Language Robot Instruction
  Following
abstract: We study the problem of learning a robot policy to follow natural language
  instructions that can be easily extended to reason about new objects. We introduce
  a few-shot language-conditioned object grounding method trained from augmented reality
  data that uses exemplars to identify objects and align them to their mentions in
  instructions. We present a learned map representation that encodes object locations
  and their instructed use, and construct it from our few-shot grounding output. We
  integrate this mapping approach into an instruction-following policy, thereby allowing
  it to  reason about previously unseen objects at test-time by simply adding exemplars.
  We evaluate on the task of learning to map raw observations and instructions to
  continuous control of a physical quadcopter. Our approach significantly outperforms
  the prior state of the art in the presence of new objects, even when the prior approach
  observes all objects during training.
