title: 'SelfVoxeLO: Self-supervised LiDAR Odometry with Voxel-based Deep Neural Networks'
abstract: 'Recent learning-based LiDAR odometry methods have demonstrated their competitiveness.
  However, most methods still face two substantial challenges: 1) the 2D projection
  representation of LiDAR data cannot effectively encode 3D structures from the point
  clouds; 2) the needs for a large amount of labeled data for training limit the application
  scope of these methods. In this paper, we propose an self-supervised LiDAR odometry
  method, dubbed SelfVoxeLO, to tackle these two difficulties. Specifically, we propose
  a 3D convolution network to process the raw LiDAR data directly, which extracts
  features that better encode the 3D geometric patterns. To suit our network to self-supervised
  learning, we design several novel loss functions that utilize the inherent properties
  of LiDAR point clouds. Moreover, an uncertainty-aware mechanism is incorporated
  in the loss functions to alleviate the interference of moving objects/noises. We
  evaluate our methodâ€™s performances on two large-scale datasets, ie, KITTI and Apollo-SouthBay.Our
  method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by 27%-32% in terms of
  translational/rotational errors on the KITTI dataset and also performs well on the
  Apollo-SouthBay dataset. By including more unlabelled training data, our method
  can further improve performance comparable to the supervised methods.'
