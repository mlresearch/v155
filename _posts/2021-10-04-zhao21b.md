title: 'TNT: Target-driven Trajectory Prediction'
abstract: Predicting the future behavior of moving agents is essential for real world
  applications. It is challenging as the intent of the agent and the corresponding
  behavior is unknown and intrinsically multimodal. Our key insight is that for prediction
  within a moderate time horizon, the future modes can be effectively captured by
  a set of target states. This leads to our target-driven trajectory prediction (TNT)
  framework. TNT has three stages which are trained end-to-end. It first predicts
  an agentâ€™s potential target states T steps into the future, by encoding its interactions
  with the environment and the other agents. TNT then generates trajectory state sequences
  conditioned on targets. A final stage estimates trajectory likelihoods and a final
  compact set of trajectory predictions is selected. This is in contrast to previous
  work which models agent intents as latent variables, and relies on test-time sampling
  to generate diverse trajectories. We benchmark TNT on trajectory prediction of vehicles
  and pedestrians, where we achieve better than state-of-the-art performance on Argoverse
  Forecasting, INTERACTION, Stanford Drone and an in-house Pedestrian-at-Intersection
  dataset.
