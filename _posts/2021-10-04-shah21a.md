title: 'LiRaNet: End-to-End Trajectory Prediction using Spatio-Temporal Radar Fusion'
abstract: In this paper, we present LiRaNet, a novel end-to-end trajectory prediction
  method which utilizes radar sensor information along with widely used lidar and
  HD maps. Automotive radar provides rich, complementary information, allowing for
  longer range vehicle detection as well as instantaneous radial velocity measurements.
  However, there are factors that make the fusion of lidar and radar information challenging,
  such as the relatively low angular resolution of radar measurements, their sparsity
  and the lack of exact time synchronization with lidar. To overcome these challenges,
  we propose an efficient spatio-temporal radar feature extraction scheme which achieves
  state-of-the-art performance on multiple large-scale datasets. Further, by incorporating
  radar information, we show a 52% reduction in prediction error for objects with
  high acceleration and a 16% reduction in prediction error for objects at longer
  range.
