title: Learning from Suboptimal Demonstration via Self-Supervised Reward Regression
abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) seeks to democratize robotics by enabling
  non-roboticist end-users to teach robots to perform a task by providing a human
  demonstration. However, modern LfD techniques, e.g. inverse reinforcement learning
  (IRL), assume users provide at least stochastically optimal demonstrations. This
  assumption fails to hold in most real-world scenarios. Recent attempts to learn
  from sub-optimal demonstration leverage pairwise rankings and following the Luce-Shepard
  rule. However, we show these approaches make incorrect assumptions and thus suffer
  from brittle, degraded performance. We overcome these limitations in developing
  a novel approach that bootstraps off suboptimal demonstrations to synthesize optimality-parameterized
  data to train an idealized reward function. We empirically validate we learn an
  idealized reward function with  0.95 correlation with ground-truth reward versus   0.75
  for prior work. We can then train policies achieving  200% improvement over the
  suboptimal demonstration and  90% improvement over prior work. We present a physical
  demonstration of teaching a robot a topspin strike in table tennis that achieves
  32% faster returns and 40% more topspin than user demonstration.
