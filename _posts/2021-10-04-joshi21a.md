title: Asynchronous Deep Model Reference Adaptive Control
abstract: In this paper, we present Asynchronous implementation of Deep Neural Network-based
  Model Reference Adaptive Control (DMRAC). We evaluate this new neuro-adaptive control
  architecture through flight tests on a small quadcopter. We demonstrate that a single
  DMRAC controller can handle significant nonlinearities due to severe system faults
  and deliberate wind disturbances while executing high-bandwidth attitude control.
  We also show that the architecture has long-term learning abilities across different
  flight regimes, and can generalize to fly different flight trajectories than those
  on which it was trained. These results demonstrating the efficacy of this architecture
  for high bandwidth closed-loop attitude control of unstable and nonlinear robots
  operating in adverse situations. To achieve these results, we designed a software+communication
  architecture to ensure online real-time inference of the deep network on a high-bandwidth
  computation-limited platform. We expect that this architecture will benefit other
  deep learning in the closed-loop experiments on robots.
