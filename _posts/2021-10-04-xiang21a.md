title: Learning RGB-D Feature Embeddings for Unseen Object Instance Segmentation
abstract: Segmenting unseen objects in cluttered scenes is an important skill that
  robots need to acquire in order to perform tasks in new environments. In this work,
  we propose a new method for unseen object instance segmentation by learning RGB-D
  feature embeddings from synthetic data. A metric learning loss function is utilized
  to learn to produce pixel-wise feature embeddings such that pixels from the same
  object are close to each other and pixels from different objects are separated in
  the embedding space. With the learned feature embeddings, a mean shift clustering
  algorithm can be applied to discover and segment unseen objects. We further improve
  the segmentation accuracy with a new two-stage clustering algorithm. Our method
  demonstrates that non-photorealistic synthetic RGB and depth images can be used
  to learn feature embeddings that transfer well to real-world images for unseen object
  instance segmentation.
