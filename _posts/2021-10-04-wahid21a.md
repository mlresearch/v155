title: Learning Object-conditioned Exploration using Distributed Soft Actor Critic
abstract: 'Object navigation is defined as navigating to an object of a given label
  in a complex, unexplored environment. In its general form, this problem poses several
  challenges for Robotics: semantic exploration of unknown environments in search
  of an object and low-level control. In this work we study object-guided exploration
  and low-level control, and present an end-to-end trained navigation policy achieving
  a success rate of 0.68 and SPL of 0.58 on unseen, visually complex scans of real
  homes. We propose a highly scalable implementation of an off-policy Reinforcement
  Learning algorithm, distributed Soft Actor Critic, which allows the system to utilize
  98M experience steps in 24 hours on 8 GPUs. Our system learns to control a differential
  drive mobile base in simulation from a stack of high dimensional observations commonly
  used on robotic platforms. The learned policy is capable of object-guided exploratory
  behaviors and low-level control learned from pure experiences in realistic environments.'
