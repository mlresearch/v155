title: 'CLOUD: Contrastive Learning of Unsupervised Dynamics'
abstract: Developing agents that can perform complex control tasks from high dimensional
  observations such as pixels is challenging due to difficulties in learning dynamics
  efficiently. In this work, we propose to learn forward and inverse dynamics in a
  fully unsupervised manner via contrastive estimation. Specifically, we train a forward
  dynamics model and an inverse dynamics model in the feature space of states and
  actions with data collected from random exploration. Unlike most existing deterministic
  models, our energy-based model takes into account the stochastic nature of agent-environment
  interactions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across a variety of tasks
  including goal-directed planning and imitation from observations.
