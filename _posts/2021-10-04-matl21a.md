title: 'STReSSD: Sim-To-Real from Sound for Stochastic Dynamics'
abstract: Sound is an information-rich medium that captures dynamic physical events.
  This work presents STReSSD, a framework that uses sound to bridge the simulation-to-reality
  gap for stochastic dynamics, demonstrated for the canonical case of a bouncing ball.
  A physically-motivated noise model is presented to capture stochastic behavior of
  the balls upon collision with the environment. A likelihood-free Bayesian inference
  framework is used to infer the parameters of the noise model, as well as a material
  property called the coefficient of restitution, from audio observations.  The same
  inference framework and the calibrated stochastic simulator are then used to learn
  a probabilistic model of ball dynamics.  The predictive capabilities of the dynamics
  model are tested in two robotic experiments. First, open-loop predictions anticipate
  probabilistic success of bouncing a ball into a cup. The second experiment integrates
  audio perception with a robotic arm to track and deflect a bouncing ball in real-time.
  We envision that this work is a step towards integrating audio-based inference for
  dynamic robotic tasks.
