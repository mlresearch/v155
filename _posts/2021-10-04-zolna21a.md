title: Task-Relevant Adversarial Imitation Learning
abstract: We show that a critical vulnerability in adversarial imitation is the tendency
  of discriminator networks to learn spurious associations between visual features
  and expert labels. When the discriminator focuses on task-irrelevant features, it
  does not provide an informative reward signal, leading to poor task performance.
  We analyze this problem in detail and propose a solution that outperforms standard
  Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL). Our proposed method, Task-Relevant
  Adversarial Imitation Learning (TRAIL), uses constrained discriminator optimization
  to learn informative rewards. In comprehensive experiments, we show that TRAIL can
  solve challenging robotic manipulation tasks from pixels by imitating human operators
  without access to any task rewards, and clearly outperforms comparable baseline
  imitation agents, including those trained via behaviour cloning and conventional
  GAIL.
