title: 'S3K: Self-Supervised Semantic Keypoints for Robotic Manipulation via Multi-View
  Consistency'
abstract: A robot’s ability to act is fundamentally constrained by what it can perceive.
  Many existing approaches to visual representation learning utilize general-purpose
  training criteria, e.g. image reconstruction, smoothness in latent space, or usefulness
  for control, or else make use of large datasets annotated with specific features
  (bounding boxes, segmentations, etc.). However, both approaches often struggle to
  capture the fine-detail required for precision tasks on specific objects, e.g. grasping
  and mating a plug and socket. We argue that these difficulties arise from a lack
  of geometric structure in these models. In this work we advocate semantic 3D keypoints
  as a visual representation, and present a semi-supervised training objective that
  can allow instance or category-level keypoints to be trained to 1-5 millimeter-accuracy
  with minimal supervision. Furthermore, unlike local texture-based approaches, our
  model integrates contextual information from a large area and is therefore robust
  to occlusion, noise, and lack of discernible texture. We demonstrate that this ability
  to locate semantic keypoints enables high level scripting of human understandable
  behaviours. Finally we show that these keypoints provide a good way to define reward
  functions for reinforcement learning and area good representation for training agents.
