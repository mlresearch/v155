title: Safe Optimal Control Using Stochastic Barrier Functions and Deep Forward-Backward
  SDEs
abstract: This paper introduces a new formulation for stochastic optimal control and
  stochastic  dynamic  optimization that ensures safety with respect to state and
  control constraints.  The proposed  methodology brings together concepts such as  Forward-Backward
  Stochastic Differential Equations,  Stochastic  Barrier Functions, Differentiable
  Convex Optimization and Deep Learning.  Using the aforementioned concepts, a Neural
  Network architecture is designed for safe trajectory optimization in which learning
  can be performed in  an end-to-end fashion. Simulations are performed on three systems
  to show the efficacy of the proposed methodology.
