title: Modeling Long-horizon Tasks as Sequential Interaction Landscapes
abstract: 'Task planning over long-time horizons is a challenging and open problem
  in robotics and its complexity grows exponentially with an increasing number of
  subtasks. In this paper we present a deep neural network that learns dependencies
  and transitions across subtasks solely from a set of demonstration videos. We represent
  each subtasks as action symbols (e.g. move cup), and show that these symbols can
  be learned and predicted directly from image observations. Learning symbol sequences
  provides the network with additional information about the most frequent transitions
  and relevant dependencies between subtasks and thereby structures tasks over long-time
  horizons. Learning from images, on the other hand, allows the network to continuously
  monitor the task progress and thus to interactively adapt to changes in the environment.
  We evaluate our framework on two long horizon tasks: (1) block stacking of puzzle
  pieces being executed by humans, and (2) a robot manipulation task involving pick
  and place of objects and sliding a cabinet door with  a 7-DoF robot arm. We show
  that complex plans can be carried out when executing the robotic task and the robot
  can interactively adapt to changes in the environment and recover from failure cases.'
