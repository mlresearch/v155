title: Tolerance-Guided Policy Learning for Adaptable and Transferrable Delicate Industrial
  Insertion
abstract: 'Policy learning for delicate industrial insertion tasks (e.g., PC board
  assembly) is challenging. This paper considers two major problems: how to learn
  a diversified policy (instead of just one average policy) that can efficiently handle
  different workpieces with minimum amount of training data, and how to handle defects
  of workpieces during insertion. To address the problems, we propose tolerance-guided
  policy learning. To encourage transferability of the learned policy to different
  workpieces, we add a task embedding to the policyâ€™s input space using the insertion
  tolerance. Then we train the policy using generative adversarial imitation learning
  with reward shaping (RS-GAIL) on a variety of representative situations. To encourage
  adaptability of the learned policy to handle defects, we build a probabilistic inference
  model that can output the best inserting pose based on failed insertions using the
  tolerance model. The best inserting pose is then used as a reference to the learned
  policy. This proposed method is validated on a sequence of IC socket insertion tasks
  in simulation. The results show that 1) RS-GAIL can efficiently learn optimal policies
  under sparse rewards; 2) the tolerance embedding can enhance the transferability
  of the learned policy; 3) the probabilistic inference makes the policy robust to
  defects on the workpieces.'
