title: Learning to Improve Multi-Robot Hallway Navigation
abstract: As multi-robot applications become more prevalent, it becomes necessary
  to develop navigation systems which allow autonomous mobile robots to efficiently
  and safely pass each other in confined spaces. Existing navigation systems, such
  as the widely used ROS Navigation Stack, usually produce safe, collision free paths
  in static environments. However, these systems are not perfect, and when multiple
  mobile robots simultaneously navigate in narrow spaces, collisions and turnarounds
  are not uncommon. Fine-tuning and enhancing such navigation stacks is not as simple
  as it looks since they are made up of multiple layers of code, and there exists
  a tradeoff between optimizing for efficiency, i.e. minimizing time to destination
  (TTD) vs. optimizing for safety, i.e. minimizing collisions, with each objective
  leading to a different combination of parameter values. In this paper we develop
  a methodology to improve existing navigation stacks with regards to both objectives,
  without tuning their parameters, while preserving their inherent safety control
  properties. Our proposed approach is a decentralized learning-based approach that
  is geared toward real world robotic deployment, by requiring little computing resources.
  It is agnostic of the underlying navigation stack and can adapt to different types
  of environmental layouts (i.e., hallway structures).
