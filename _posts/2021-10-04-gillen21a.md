title: Explicitly Encouraging Low Fractional Dimensional Trajectories Via Reinforcement
  Learning
abstract: A key limitation in using various modern methods of machine learning in
  developing feedback control policies is the lack of appropriate methodologies to
  analyze their long-term dynamics, in terms of making any sort of guarantees (even
  statistically) about robustness.  The central reasons for this are largely due to
  the so-called curse of dimensionality, combined with the black-box nature of the
  resulting control policies themselves. This paper aims at the first of these issues.
  Although the full state space of a system may be quite large in dimensionality,
  it is a common feature of most model-based control methods that the resulting closed-loop
  systems demonstrate dominant dynamics that are rapidly driven to some lower-dimensional
  sub-space within. In this work we argue that the dimensionality of this subspace
  is captured by tools from fractal geometry, namely various notions of a fractional
  dimension. We then show that the dimensionality of trajectories induced by model
  free reinforcement learning agents can be influenced adding a post processing function
  to the agents reward signal. We verify that the dimensionality reduction is robust
  to noise being added to the system and show that that the modified agents are more
  actually more robust to noise and push disturbances in general for the systems we
  examined.
