title: Sample-efficient Cross-Entropy Method for Real-time Planning
abstract: Trajectory optimizers for model-based reinforcement learning, such as the  Cross-Entropy
  Method (CEM), can yield compelling results even in high-dimensional control tasks
  and sparse-reward environments. However, their sampling inefficiency prevents them
  from being used for real-time planning and control. We propose an improved version
  of the CEM algorithm for fast planning, with novel additions including temporally-correlated
  actions and memory, requiring 2.7-22x less samples and yielding a performance increase
  of 1.2-10x in high-dimensional control problems.
