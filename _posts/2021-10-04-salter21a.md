title: Attention-Privileged Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'Image-based Reinforcement Learning is known to suffer from poor sample
  efficiency and generalisation to unseen visuals such as distractors (task-independent
  aspects of the observation space). Visual domain randomisation encourages transfer
  by training over visual factors of variation that may be encountered in the target
  domain. This increases learning complexity, can negatively impact learning rate
  and performance, and requires knowledge of potential variations during deployment.
  In this paper, we introduce Attention-Privileged Reinforcement Learning (APRiL)
  which uses a self-supervised attention mechanism to significantly alleviate these
  drawbacks: by focusing on task-relevant aspects of the observations, attention provides
  robustness to distractors as well as significantly increased learning efficiency.
  APRiL trains two attention-augmented actor-critic agents: one purely based on image
  observations, available across training and transfer domains; and one with access
  to privileged information (such as environment states) available only during training.
  Experience is shared between both agents and their attention mechanisms are aligned.
  The image-based policy can then be deployed without access to privileged information.
  We experimentally demonstrate accelerated and more robust learning on a diverse
  set of domains, leading to improved final performance for environments both within
  and outside the training distribution.'
