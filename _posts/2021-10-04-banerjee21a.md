title: 'The RobotSlang Benchmark: Dialog-guided Robot Localization and Navigation'
abstract: Autonomous robot systems for applications from search and rescue to assistive
  guidance should be able to engage in natural language dialog with people. To study
  such cooperative communication, we introduce Robot Simultaneous Localization and
  Mapping with Natural Language (RobotSlang), a benchmark of 169 natural language
  dialogs between a human Driver controlling a robot and a human Commander providing
  guidance towards navigation goals. In each trial, the pair first cooperates to localize
  the robot on a global map visible to the Commander, then the Driver follows Commander
  instructions to move the robot to a sequence of target objects. We introduce a Localization
  from Dialog History (LDH) and a Navigation from Dialog History (NDH) task where
  a learned agent is given dialog and visual observations from the robot platform
  as input and must localize in the global map or navigate towards the next target
  object, respectively. RobotSlang is comprised of nearly 5k utterances and over 1k
  minutes of robot camera and control streams. We present an initial model for the
  NDH task, and show that an agent trained in simulation can follow the RobotSlang
  dialog-based navigation instructions for controlling a physical robot platform.
