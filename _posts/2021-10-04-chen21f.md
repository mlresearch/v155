title: 'Robust Policies via Mid-Level Visual Representations: An Experimental Study
  in Manipulation and Navigation'
abstract: Vision-based robotics often factors the control loop into separate components
  for perception and control. Conventional perception components usually extract hand-engineered
  features from the visual input that are then used by the control component in an
  explicit manner. In contrast, recent advances in deep RL make it possible to learn
  these features end-to-end during training, but the final result is often brittle,
  fails unexpectedly under minuscule visual shifts, and comes with a high sample complexity
  cost. In this work, we study the effects of using mid-level visual representations
  asynchronously trained for traditional computer vision objectives as a generic and
  easy-to-decode perceptual state in an end-to-end RL framework. We show that the
  invariances provided by the mid-level representations aid generalization, improve
  sample complexity, and lead to a higher final performance. Compared to the alternative
  approaches for incorporating invariances, such as domain randomization, using asynchronously
  trained mid-level representations scale better to harder problems and larger domain
  shifts, and consequently, successfully trains policies for tasks where domain randomization
  or learning-from-scratch failed. Our experimental findings are reported on manipulation
  and navigation tasks using real robots as well as simulations.
