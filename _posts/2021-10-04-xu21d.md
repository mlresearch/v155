title: Hierarchical Robot Navigation in Novel Environments using Rough 2-D Maps
abstract: In robot navigation, generalizing quickly to unseen environments is essential.  Hierarchical
  methods inspired by human navigation have been proposed, typically consisting of
  a high-level landmark proposer and a low-level controller. However, these methods
  either require precise high-level information to be given in advance, or need to
  construct such guidance from extensive interaction with the environment. In this
  work, we propose an approach that leverages a rough 2-D map of the environment to
  navigate in novel environments without requiring further learning. In particular,
  we introduce a dynamic topological map that can be initialized from the rough 2-D
  map along with a high-level planning approach for proposing reachable 2-D map patches
  of the intermediate landmarks between the start and goal locations. To use proposed
  2-D patches, we train a deep generative model to generate intermediate landmarks
  in observation space which are used as subgoals by low-level goal-conditioned reinforcement
  learning. Importantly, because the low-level controller is only trained with local
  behaviors (e.g. go across the intersection, turn left at a corner) on existing environments,
  this framework allows us to generalize to novel environments given only a rough
  2-D map, without requiring further learning. Experimental results demonstrate the
  effectiveness of the proposed framework in both seen and novel environments.
