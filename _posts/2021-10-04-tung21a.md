title: '3D-OES: Viewpoint-Invariant Object-Factorized Environment Simulators'
abstract: We propose an action-conditioned dynamics model that predicts scene changes
  caused by object and agent interactions in a viewpoint-invariant 3D neural scene
  representation space, inferred from RGB-D videos. In this 3D feature space, objects
  do not interfere with one another and their appearance persists over time and across
  viewpoints. This permits our model to predict future scenes long in the future by
  simply “moving” 3D object features based on cumulative object motion predictions.  Object
  motion predictions are computed by a graph neural network that operates over the
  object features extracted from the 3D neural scene representation. Our model’s simulations
  can be decoded by a neural renderer into 2D image views from any desired viewpoint,
  which aids the interpretability of our latent 3D simulation space.  We show our
  model generalizes well its predictions across varying number and appearances of
  interacting objects as well as across camera viewpoints, outperforming existing
  2D and 3D dynamics models. We further demonstrate sim-to-real transfer of the learnt
  dynamics by applying our model trained solely in simulation to model-based control
  for pushing objects to desired locations under clutter on a real robotic setup.
