title: Range Conditioned Dilated Convolutions for Scale Invariant 3D Object Detection
abstract: 'This paper presents a novel 3D object detection framework that processes
  LiDAR data directly on its native representation: range images. Benefiting from
  the compactness of range images, 2D convolutions can efficiently process dense LiDAR
  data of the scene. To overcome scale sensitivity in this perspective view, a novel
  range-conditioned dilation (RCD) layer is proposed to dynamically adjust a continuous
  dilation rate as a function of the measured range. Furthermore, localized soft range
  gating combined with a 3D box-refinement stage improves robustness in occluded areas,
  and produces overall more accurate bounding box predictions. On the public large-scale
  Waymo Open Dataset, our method sets a new baseline for range-based 3D detection,
  outperforming multiview and voxel-based methods over all ranges with unparalleled
  performance at long range detection.'
