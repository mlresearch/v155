title: Learning an Expert Skill-Space for Replanning Dynamic Quadruped Locomotion
  over Obstacles
abstract: Function approximators are increasingly being considered as a tool for generating
  robot motions that are temporally extended and express foresight about the scenario
  at hand. While these longer behaviors are often necessary or beneficial, they also
  induce multimodality in the decision space, which complicates the training of a
  regression model on expert data. Motivated by the problem of quadrupedal locomotion
  over obstacles, we apply an approach that disentangles modal variation from task-to-solution
  regression by using a conditional variational autoencoder. The resulting decoder
  is a regression model that outputs trajectories based on the task and a real-valued
  latent mode vector representing a style of behavior. With the task consisting of
  robot-relative descriptions of the state, the goal, and nearby obstacles, this model
  is suitable for receding-horizon generation of structured dynamic motion. We test
  this approach, along with a trajectory library baseline method, for producing sustained
  locomotion plans that use a generalized gait. Both options strongly bias planned
  footholds away from obstacle regions, while the multimodal regressor is far less
  susceptible to violating kinematic constraints. We conclude by identifying further
  prospective benefits of the continuous latent mode representation, along with targets
  for future integration into a hardware-deployable pipeline including perception
  and control.
