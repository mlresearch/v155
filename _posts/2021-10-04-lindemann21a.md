title: Learning Hybrid Control Barrier Functions from Data
abstract: Motivated by the lack of systematic tools to obtain safe control laws for
  hybrid systems, we propose an optimization-based framework for learning certifiably
  safe control laws from data. In particular, we assume a setting in which the system
  dynamics are known and in which data exhibiting safe system behavior is available.
  We propose hybrid control barrier functions for hybrid systems as a means to synthesize
  safe control inputs. Based on this notion, we present an optimization-based framework
  to learn such hybrid control barrier functions from data. Importantly, we identify
  sufficient conditions on the data such that feasibility of the optimization problem
  ensures correctness of the learned hybrid control barrier functions, and hence the
  safety of the system. We illustrate our findings in two simulations studies, including
  a compass gait walker.
