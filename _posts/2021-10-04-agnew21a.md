title: Amodal 3D Reconstruction for Robotic Manipulation via Stability and Connectivity
abstract: Learning-based 3D object reconstruction enables single- or few-shot estimation
  of 3D object models. For robotics,  this holds the potential to allow model-based
  methods to rapidly adapt to novel objects and scenes. Existing 3D reconstruction
  techniques optimize for visual reconstruction fidelity, typically measured by chamfer
  distance or voxel IOU. We find that when applied to realistic, cluttered robotics
  environments, these systems produce reconstructions with low physical realism, resulting
  in poor task performance when used for model-based control.  We propose ARM, an
  amodal 3D reconstruction system that introduces (1) a stability prior over object
  shapes, (2) a connectivity prior, and (3) a multi-channel input representation that
  allows for reasoning over relationships between groups of objects.  By using these
  priors over the physical properties of objects, our system improves reconstruction
  quality not just by standard visual metrics, but also performance of model-based
  control on a variety of robotics manipulation tasks in challenging, cluttered environments.
