title: 'S3CNet: A Sparse Semantic Scene Completion Network for LiDAR Point Clouds'
abstract: With the increasing reliance of self-driving and similar robotic systems
  on robust 3D vision, the processing of LiDAR scans with deep convolutional neural
  networks has become a trend in academia and industry alike. Prior attempts on the
  challenging Semantic Scene Completion task - which entails the inference of dense
  3D structure and associated semantic labels from “sparse” representations - have
  been, to a degree, successful in small indoor scenes when provided with dense point
  clouds or dense depth maps often fused with semantic segmentation maps from RGB
  images. However, the performance of these systems drop drastically when applied
  to large outdoor scenes characterized by dynamic and exponentially sparser conditions.
  Likewise, processing of the entire sparse volume becomes infeasible due to memory
  limitations and workarounds introduce computational inefficiency as practitioners
  are forced to divide the overall volume into multiple equal segments and infer on
  each individually, rendering real-time performance impossible. In this work, we
  formulate a method that subsumes the sparsity of large-scale environments and present
  S3CNet, a sparse convolution based neural network that predicts the semantically
  completed scene from a single, unified LiDAR point cloud. We show that our proposed
  method outperforms all counterparts on the 3D task, achieving state-of-the art results
  on the SemanticKITTI benchmark. Furthermore, we propose a 2D variant of S3CNet with
  a multi-view fusion strategy to complement our 3D network, providing robustness
  to occlusions and extreme sparsity in distant regions. We conduct experiments for
  the 2D semantic scene completion task and compare the results of our sparse 2D network
  against several leading LiDAR segmentation models adapted for bird’s eye view segmentation
  on two open-source datasets.
