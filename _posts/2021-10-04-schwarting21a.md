title: 'Deep Latent Competition: Learning to Race Using Visual Control Policies in
  Latent Space'
abstract: Learning competitive behaviors in multi-agent settings such as racing requires
  long-term reasoning about potential adversarial interactions. This paper presents
  Deep Latent Competition (DLC), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that learns
  competitive visual control policies through self-play in imagination. The DLC agent
  imagines multi-agent interaction sequences in the compact latent space of a learned
  world model that combines a joint transition function with opponent viewpoint prediction.
  Imagined self-play reduces costly sample generation in the real world, while the
  latent representation enables planning to scale gracefully with observation dimensionality.  We
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in learning competitive behaviors
  on a novel multi-agent racing benchmark that requires planning from image observations.
