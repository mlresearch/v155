title: 'EXI-Net: EXplicitly/Implicitly Conditioned Network for Multiple Environment
  Sim-to-Real Transfer'
abstract: Sim-to-real transfer is attractive for robot learning, as it avoids the
  high cost of collecting data with real robots, but transferring agents from simulation
  to the real world is challenging. Previous studies have presented promising methods
  to solve this problem, but they may fail when a wider range of dynamics has to be
  considered. In this study, we propose a network architecture with explicit and implicit
  dynamics parameters for sim-to-real transfer from multiple environments. Using this
  method, we can simultaneously estimate the dynamics of the real world and optimize
  the action in various kinds of environments. The core novelty lies in the simultaneous
  dynamics estimation and action optimization, as well as the use of explicit (physically
  quantifiable) and implicit (latent) dynamics parameters to condition the network
  input. We apply our method to the object pushing task and verify its effectiveness
  by comparing it with previous methods and real-world experiments.
