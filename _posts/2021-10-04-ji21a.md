title: Multi-Modal Anomaly Detection for Unstructured and Uncertain Environments
abstract: 'To achieve high-levels of autonomy, modern robots require the ability to
  detect and recover from anomalies and failures with minimal human supervision. Multi-modal
  sensor signals could provide more information for such anomaly detection tasks;
  however, the fusion of high-dimensional and heterogeneous sensor modalities remains
  a challenging problem. We propose a deep learning neural network: supervised variational
  autoencoder (SVAE), for failure identification in unstructured and uncertain environments.
  Our model leverages the representational power of VAE to extract robust features
  from high-dimensional inputs for supervised learning tasks. The training objective
  unifies the generative model and the discriminative model, thus making the learning
  a one-stage procedure. Our experiments on real field robot data demonstrate superior
  failure identification performance than baseline methods, and that our model learns
  interpretable representations.'
