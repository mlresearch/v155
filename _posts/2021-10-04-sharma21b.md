title: Relational Learning for Skill Preconditions
abstract: 'To determine if a skill can be executed in any given environment, a robot
  needs to learn the preconditions for the skill. As robots begin to operate in dynamic
  and unstructured environments, these precondition models will need to generalize
  to variable number of objects with different shapes and sizes. In this work, we
  focus on learning precondition models for manipulation skills in unconstrained environments.
  Our work is motivated by the intuition that many complex manipulation tasks, with
  multiple objects, can be simplified by focusing on less complex pairwise object
  relations. We propose an object-relation model that learns continuous representations
  for these pairwise object relations.  Our object-relation model is trained completely
  in simulation, and once learned, is used by a separate precondition model to predict
  skill preconditions for real world tasks. We evaluate our precondition model on
  3 different manipulation tasks: sweeping, cutting, and unstacking.  We show that
  our approach leads to significant improvements in predicting preconditions for all
  3 tasks, across objects of different shapes and sizes.'
