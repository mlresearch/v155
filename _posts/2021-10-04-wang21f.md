title: Policy learning in SE(3) action spaces
abstract: In the spatial action representation, the action space spans the space of
  target poses for robot motion commands, i.e. SE(2) or SE(3). This approach has been
  used to solve challenging robotic manipulation problems and shows promise. However,
  the method is often limited to a three dimensional action space and short horizon
  tasks. This paper proposes ASRSE3, a new method for handling higher dimensional
  spatial action spaces that transforms an original MDP with high dimensional action
  space into a new MDP with reduced action space and augmented state space. We also
  propose SDQfD, a variation of DQfD designed for large action spaces. ASRSE3 and
  SDQfD are evaluated in the context of a set of challenging block construction tasks.
  We show that both methods outperform standard baselines and can be used in practice
  on real robotics systems.
