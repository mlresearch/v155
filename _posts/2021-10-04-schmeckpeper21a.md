title: 'Reinforcement Learning with Videos: Combining Offline Observations with Interaction'
abstract: " Reinforcement learning is a powerful framework for robots to acquire skills
  from experience, but often requires a substantial amount of online data collection.
  As a result, it is difficult to collect sufficiently diverse experiences that are
  needed for robots to generalize broadly. Videos of humans, on the other hand, are
  a readily available source of broad and interesting experiences. In this paper,
  we consider the question: can we perform reinforcement learning directly on experience
  collected by humans? This problem is particularly difficult, as such videos are
  not annotated with actions and exhibit substantial visual domain shift relative
  to the robotâ€™s embodiment. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for
  reinforcement learning with videos (RLV). RLV learns a policy and value function
  using experience collected by humans in combination with data collected by robots.
  In our experiments, we find that RLV is able to leverage such videos to learn challenging
  vision-based skills with less than half as many samples as RL methods that learn
  from scratch."
