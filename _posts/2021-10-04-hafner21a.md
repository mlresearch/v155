title: 'Towards General and Autonomous Learning of Core Skills: A Case Study in Locomotion'
abstract: Modern Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms promise to solve difficult
  motor control problems directly from raw sensory inputs. Their attraction is due
  in part to the fact that they can represent a general class of methods that allow
  to learn a solution with a reasonably set reward and minimal prior knowledge, even
  in situations where it is difficult or expensive for a human expert. For RL to truly
  make good on this promise, however, we need algorithms and learning setups that
  can work across a broad range of problems with minimal problem specific adjustments
  or engineering. In this paper, we study this idea of generality in the locomotion
  domain. We develop a learning framework that can learn sophisticated locomotion
  behaviour for a wide spectrum of legged robots, such as bipeds, tripeds, quadrupeds
  and hexapods, including wheeled variants. Our learning framework relies on a data-efficient,
  off-policy multi-task RL algorithm and a small set of reward functions that are
  semantically identical across robots. To underline the general applicability of
  the method, we keep the hyper-parameter settings and reward definitions constant
  across experiments and rely exclusively on on-board sensing. For nine different
  types of robots, including a real-world quadruped robot, we demonstrate that the
  same algorithm can rapidly learn diverse and reusable locomotion skills without
  any platform specific adjustments or additional instrumentation of the learning
  setup.
