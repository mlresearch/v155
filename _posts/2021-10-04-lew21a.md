title: 'Sampling-based Reachability Analysis: A Random Set Theory Approach with Adversarial
  Sampling'
abstract: Reachability analysis is at the core of many applications, from neural network
  verification, to safe trajectory planning of uncertain systems. However, this problem
  is notoriously challenging, and current approaches tend to be either too restrictive,
  too slow, too conservative, or approximate and therefore lack guarantees. In this
  paper, we propose a simple yet effective sampling-based approach to perform reachability
  analysis for arbitrary dynamical systems. Our key novel idea consists of using random
  set theory to give a rigorous interpretation of our method, and prove that it returns
  sets which are guaranteed to converge to the convex hull of the true reachable sets.
  Additionally, we leverage recent work on robust deep learning and propose a new
  adversarial sampling approach to robustify our algorithm and accelerate its convergence.
  We demonstrate that our method is faster and less conservative than prior work,
  present results for approximate reachability analysis of neural networks and robust
  trajectory optimization of high-dimensional uncertain nonlinear systems, and discuss
  future applications.
