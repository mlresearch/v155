title: Time-Bounded Mission Planning in Time-Varying Domains with Semi-MDPs and Gaussian
  Processes
abstract: Uncertain, time-varying dynamic environments are ubiquitous in real world
  robotics. We propose an online planning framework to address time-bounded missions
  under time-varying dynamics, where those dynamics affect the duration and outcome
  of actions. We pose such problems as semi-Markov decision processes, where actions
  have a duration distributed according to an a priori unknown time-varying function.
  Our approach maintains a belief over this function, and time is propagated through
  a discrete search tree that efficiently maintains a subset of reachable states.
  We show improved mission performance on a marine vehicle simulator acting under
  real-world spatio-temporal ocean currents, and demonstrate the ability to solve
  co-safe linear temporal logic problems, which are more complex than the reachability
  problems tackled in previous approaches.
