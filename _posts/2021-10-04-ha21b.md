title: 'Fit2Form: 3D Generative Model for Robot Gripper Form Design'
abstract: The 3D shape of a robot’s end-effector plays a critical role in determining
  it’s functionality and overall performance. Many of today’s industrial applications
  rely on highly customized gripper design for a given task to ensure the system’s
  robustness and accuracy.  However, the process of manual hardware design is both
  costly and time-consuming, and the quality of the design is also dependent on the
  engineer’s experience and domain expertise, which can easily be out-dated or inaccurate.  The
  goal of this paper is to use machine learning algorithms to automate this design
  process and generate task-specific gripper designs that satisfy a set of pre-defined
  design objectives. We model the design objectives by training a Fitness network
  to predict their values for a pair of gripper fingers and a grasp object. This Fitness
  network is then used to provide training supervision to a 3D Generative network
  that produces a pair of 3D finger geometries for the target grasp object. Our experiments
  demonstrate that the proposed 3D generative design framework generates parallel
  jaw gripper finger shapes that achieve more stable and robust grasps as compared
  to other general-purpose and task-specific gripper design algorithms.
