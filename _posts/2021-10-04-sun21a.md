title: Neuro-Symbolic Program Search for Autonomous Driving Decision Module Design
abstract: As a promising topic in cognitive robotics, neuro-symbolic modeling integrates
  symbolic reasoning and neural representation altogether. However, previous neuro-symbolic
  models usually wire their structures and the connections manually, making the underlying
  parameters sub-optimal. In this work, we propose the Neuro-Symbolic Program Search
  (NSPS) to improve the autonomous driving system design. NSPS is a novel automated
  search method that synthesizes the Neuro-Symbolic Programs. It can produce robust
  and expressive Neuro-Symbolic Programs and automatically tune the hyper-parameters.
  We validate NSPS in the CARLA driving simulation environment. The resulting Neuro-Symbolic
  Decision Programs successfully handle multiple traffic scenarios. Compared with
  previous neural-network-based driving and rule-based methods, our neuro-symbolic
  driving pipeline achieves more stable and safer behaviors in complex driving scenarios
  while maintaining an interpretable symbolic decision-making process.
