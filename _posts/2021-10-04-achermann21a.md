title: 'MultiPoint: Cross-spectral registration of thermal and optical aerial imagery'
abstract: While optical cameras are ubiquitous in robotics, some robots can sense
  the world in several sections of the electromagnetic spectrum simultaneously, which
  can extend their capabilities in fundamental ways. For instance, many fixed-wing
  UAVs carry both optical and thermal imaging cameras, potentially allowing them to
  detect temperature difference-induced atmospheric updrafts, map their locations,
  and adjust their flight path accordingly to increase their time aloft. A key step
  for unlocking the potential offered by multi-spectral data is generating consistent,
  multi-spectral maps of the environment. In this work, we introduce MultiPoint, a
  novel data-driven method for generating interest points and associated descriptors
  for registering optical and thermal image pairs without knowledge of the relative
  camera viewpoints. Existing pixel-based alignment methods are accurate but too slow
  to work in near-real time, while feature-based methods such as SuperPoint are fast
  but produce poor-quality cross-spectral matches due to interest point instability
  in thermal images. MultiPoint capitalizes on the strengths of both approaches. An
  offline mutual information-based procedure is used to align cross-spectral image
  pairs from a training set, which are then processed by our generalized multi-spectral
  homographic adaptation stage to generate highly repeatable interest points that
  are invariant across viewpoint changes in both spectra. These are used to train
  a MultiPoint deep neural network by exposing  this model to both same-spectrum and
  cross-spectral image pairs. This model is then deployed for fast and accurate online
  interest point detection. We show that MultiPoint outperforms existing techniques
  for feature-based image alignment using a dataset of real-world thermal-optical
  imagery captured by a UAV during flights in different conditions and release this
  dataset, the first of its kind.
