title: Belief-Grounded Networks for Accelerated Robot Learning under Partial Observability
abstract: Many important robotics problems are partially observable where a single
  visual or force-feedback measurement is insufficient to reconstruct the state. Standard
  approaches involve learning a policy over beliefs or observation-action histories.    However,
  both of these have drawbacks; it is expensive to track the belief online, and it
  is hard to learn policies directly over histories. We propose a method for policy
  learning under partial observability called the Belief-Grounded Network (BGN) in
  which an auxiliary belief-reconstruction loss incentivizes a neural network to concisely
  summarize its input history. Since the resulting policy is a function of the history
  rather than the belief, it can be executed easily at runtime. We compare BGN against
  several baselines on classic benchmark tasks as well as three novel robotic force-feedback
  tasks. BGN outperforms all other tested methods and its learned policies work well
  when transferred onto a physical robot.
