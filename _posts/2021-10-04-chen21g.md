title: Deep Phase Correlation for End-to-End Heterogeneous Sensor Measurements Matching
abstract: The crucial step for localization is to match the current observation to
  the map. When the two sensor modalities are significantly different, matching becomes
  challenging. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep phase correlation network
  (DPCN) to match heterogeneous sensor measurements. In DPCN, the primary component
  is a differentiable correlation-based estimator that back-propagates the pose error
  to learnable feature extractors, which addresses the problem that there are no direct
  common features for supervision. In addition, it eliminates the exhaustive evaluation
  in some previous methods, improving efficiency. With the interpretable modeling,
  the network is light-weighted and promising for better generalization. We evaluate
  the system on both the simulation data and Aero-Ground Dataset which consists of
  heterogeneous sensor images and aerial images acquired by satellites or aerial robots.
  The results show that our method is able to match the heterogeneous sensor measurements,
  outperforming the comparative traditional phase correlation and other learning-based
  methods. Code is available at https://github.com/jessychen1016/DPCN .
