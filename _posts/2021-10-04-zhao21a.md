title: 'SAM: Squeeze-and-Mimic Networks for Conditional Visual Driving Policy Learning'
abstract: We describe a policy learning approach to map visual inputs to driving controls
  conditioned on turning command that leverages side tasks on semantics and object
  affordances via a learned representation trained for driving. To learn this representation,
  we train a squeeze network to drive using annotations for the side task as input.
  This representation encodes the driving-relevant information associated with the
  side task while ideally throwing out side task-relevant but driving-irrelevant nuisances.
  We then train a mimic network to drive using only images as input and use the squeeze
  networkâ€™s latent representation to supervise the mimic network via a mimicking loss.
  Notably, we do not aim to achieve the side task nor to learn features for it; instead,
  we aim to learn, via the mimicking loss, a representation of the side task annotations
  directly useful for driving. We test our approach using the CARLA simulator. In
  addition, we introduce a more challenging but realistic evaluation protocol that
  considers a run that reaches the destination successful only if it does not violate
  common traffic rules.
