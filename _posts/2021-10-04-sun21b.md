title: Learning Certified Control Using Contraction Metric
abstract: In this paper, we solve the problem of finding a certified control policy
  that drives a robot from any given initial state and under any bounded disturbance
  to the desired reference trajectory, with guarantees on the convergence or bounds
  on the tracking error. Such a controller is crucial in safe motion planning. We
  leverage the advanced theory in Control Contraction Metric and design a learning
  framework based on neural networks to co-synthesize the contraction metric and the
  controller for control-affine systems. We further provide methods to validate the
  convergence and bounded error guarantees. We demonstrate the performance of our
  method using a suite of challenging robotic models, including models with learned
  dynamics as neural networks. We compare our approach with leading methods using
  sum-of-squares programming, reinforcement learning, and model predictive control.
  Results show that our methods indeed can handle a broader class of systems with
  less tracking error and faster execution speed. Code is available at https://github.com/sundw2014/C3M.
