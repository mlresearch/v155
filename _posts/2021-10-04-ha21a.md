title: Learning a Decentralized Multi-Arm Motion Planner
abstract: We present a closed-loop multi-arm motion planner that is scalable and flexible
  with team size. Traditional multi-arm robotic systems have relied on centralized
  motion planners, whose run times often scale exponentially with team size, and thus,
  fail to handle dynamic environments with open-loop control. In this paper, we tackle
  this problem with multi-agent reinforcement learning, where a shared policy network
  is trained to control each individual robot arm to reach its target end-effector
  pose given observations of its workspace state and target end-effector pose. The
  policy is trained using Soft Actor-Critic with expert demonstrations from a sampling-based
  motion planning algorithm (i.e., BiRRT). By leveraging classical planning algorithms,
  we can improve the learning efficiency of the reinforcement learning algorithm while
  retaining the fast inference time of neural networks. The resulting policy scales
  sub-linearly and can be deployed on multi-arm systems with variable team sizes.
  Thanks to the closed-loop and decentralized formulation, our approach generalizes
  to 5-10 multiarm systems and dynamic moving targets (>90% success rate for a 10-arm
  system), despite being trained on only 1-4 arm planning tasks with static targets.
