title: Augmenting GAIL with BC for sample efficient imitation learning
abstract: Imitation learning is the problem of recovering an expert policy without
  access to a reward signal. Behavior cloning and GAIL are two widely used methods
  for performing imitation learning. Behavior cloning converges in a few iterations,
  but doesnâ€™t achieve peak performance due to its inherent iid assumption about the
  state-action distribution. GAIL addresses the issue by accounting for the temporal
  dependencies when performing a state distribution matching between the agent and
  the expert. Although GAIL is sample efficient in the number of expert trajectories
  required, it is still not very sample efficient in terms of the environment interactions
  needed for convergence of the policy. Given the complementary benefits of both methods,
  we present a simple and elegant method to combine both methods to enable stable
  and sample efficient learning. Our algorithm is very simple to implement and integrates
  with different policy gradient algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
  algorithm in low dimensional control tasks, gridworlds and in high dimensional image-based
  tasks.
