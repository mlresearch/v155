title: Interactive Imitation Learning in State-Space
abstract: Imitation Learning techniques enable programming the behaviour of agents
  through demonstrations rather than manual engineering. However, they are limited
  by the quality of available demonstration data. Interactive Imitation Learning techniques
  can improve the efficacy of learning since they involve teachers providing feedback
  while the agent executes its task. In this work, we propose a novel Interactive
  Learning technique that uses human feedback in state-space to train and improve
  agent behaviour (as opposed to alternative methods that use feedback in action-space).
  Our method titled Teaching Imitative Policies in State-space (TIPS) enables providing
  guidance to the agent in terms of ‘changing its state’ which is often more intuitive
  for a human demonstrator. Through continuous improvement via corrective feedback,
  agents trained by non-expert demonstrators using TIPS outperformed the demonstrator
  and conventional Imitation Learning agents.
