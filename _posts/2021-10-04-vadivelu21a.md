title: Learning to Communicate and Correct Pose Errors
abstract: Learned communication makes multi-agent systems more effective by aggregating
  distributed information. However, it also exposes individual agents to the threat
  of erroneous messages they receive. In this paper, we study the setting proposed
  in V2VNet, where nearby self-driving vehicles jointly perform object detection and
  motion forecasting in a cooperative manner. Despite a huge performance boost when
  the agents solve the task together, the gain is quickly diminished in the presence
  of pose noise since the communication relies on spatial transformations. Hence,
  we propose a novel neural reasoning framework that learns to communicate, to estimate
  errors, and finally, to reach a consensus about those errors. Experiments confirm
  that our proposed framework significantly improves the robustness of multi-agent
  self-driving perception systems under realistic and severe localization noise.
