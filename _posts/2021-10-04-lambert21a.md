title: Stein Variational Model Predictive Control
abstract: Decision making under uncertainty is critical to real-world, autonomous
  systems. Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods have demonstrated favorable performance
  in practice, but remain limited when dealing with complex probability distributions.
  In this paper, we propose a generalization of MPC that represents a multitude of
  solutions as posterior distributions. By casting MPC as a Bayesian inference problem,
  we employ variational methods for posterior computation, naturally encoding the
  complexity and multi-modality of the decision making problem. We propose a Stein
  variational gradient descent method to estimate the posterior over control parameters,
  given a cost function and a sequence of state observations. We show that this framework
  leads to successful planning in challenging, non-convex optimal control problems.
