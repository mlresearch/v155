title: Integrating Egocentric Localization for More Realistic Point-Goal Navigation
  Agents
abstract: Recent work has presented embodied agents that can navigate to point-goal
  targets in novel indoor environments with near-perfect accuracy. However, these
  agents are equipped with idealized sensors for localization and take deterministic
  actions. This setting is practically sterile by comparison to the dirty reality
  of noisy sensors and actuations in the real world – wheels can slip, motion sensors
  have error, actuations can rebound. In this work, we take a step towards this noisy
  reality, developing point-goal navigation agents that rely on visual estimates of
  egomotion under noisy action dynamics. We find these agents outperform naive adaptions
  of current point-goal agents to this setting as well as those incorporating classic
  localization baselines. Further, our model conceptually divides learning agent dynamics
  or odometry (where am I?) from task-specific navigation policy (where do I want
  to go?). This enables a seamless adaption to changing dynamics (a different robot
  or floor type) by simply re-calibrating the visual odometry model – circumventing
  the expense of re-training of the navigation policy. Our agent was the runner-up
  in the PointNav track of CVPR 2020 Habitat Challenge.
