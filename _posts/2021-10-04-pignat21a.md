title: Generative adversarial training of product of policies for robust and adaptive
  movement primitives
abstract: In learning from demonstrations, many generative models of trajectories
  make simplifying assumptions of independence. Correctness is sacrificed in the name
  of tractability and speed of the learning phase. The ignored dependencies, which
  are often the kinematic and dynamic constraints of the system, are then only restored
  when synthesizing the motion, which introduces possibly heavy distortions. In this
  work, we propose to use those approximate trajectory distributions as close-to-optimal
  discriminators in the popular generative adversarial framework to stabilize and
  accelerate the learning procedure. The two problems of adaptability and robustness
  are addressed with our method. In order to adapt the motions to varying contexts,
  we propose to use a product of Gaussian policies defined in several parametrized
  task spaces. Robustness to perturbations and varying dynamics is ensured with the
  use of stochastic gradient descent and ensemble methods to learn the stochastic
  dynamics. Two experiments are performed on a 7-DoF manipulator to validate the approach.
