title: Sim2Real Transfer for Deep Reinforcement Learning with Stochastic State Transition
  Delays
abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated to be useful for a wide
  variety of robotics applications. To address sample efficiency and safety during
  training, it is common to train Deep RL policies in a simulator and then deploy
  to the real world, a process called Sim2Real transfer.  For robotics applications,
  the deployment heterogeneities and runtime compute stochasticity results in variable
  timing characteristics of sensor sampling rates and end-to-end delays from sensing
  to actuation. Prior works have used the technique of domain randomization to enable
  the successful transfer of policies across domains having different state transition
  delays. We show that variation in sampling rates and policy execution time leads
  to degradation in Deep RL policy performance, and that domain randomization is insufficient
  to overcome this limitation. We propose the Time-in-State RL (TSRL) approach, which
  includes delays and sampling rate as additional agent observations at training time
  to improve the robustness of Deep RL policies. We demonstrate the efficacy of TSRL
  on HalfCheetah, Ant, and car robot in simulation and on a real robot using a 1/18th
  scale car.
