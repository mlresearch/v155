title: Uncertainty-Aware Constraint Learning for Adaptive Safe Motion Planning from
  Demonstrations
abstract: We present a method for learning to satisfy uncertain constraints from demonstrations.
  Our method uses robust optimization to obtain a belief over the potentially infinite
  set of possible constraints consistent with the demonstrations, and then uses this
  belief to plan trajectories that trade off performance with satisfying the possible
  constraints. We use these trajectories in a closed-loop policy that executes and
  replans using belief updates, which incorporate data gathered during execution.
  We derive guarantees on the accuracy of our constraint belief and probabilistic
  guarantees on plan safety. We present results on a 7-DOF arm and 12D quadrotor,
  showing our method can learn to satisfy high-dimensional (up to 30D) uncertain constraints
  and outperforms baselines in safety and efficiency.
