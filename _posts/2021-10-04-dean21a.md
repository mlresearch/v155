title: Guaranteeing Safety of Learned Perception Modules via Measurement-Robust Control
  Barrier Functions
abstract: Modern nonlinear control theory seeks to develop feedback controllers that
  endow systems with properties such as safety and stability. The guarantees ensured
  by these controllers often rely on accurate estimates of the system state for determining
  control actions. In practice, measurement model uncertainty can lead to error in
  state estimates that degrades these guarantees. In this paper, we seek to unify
  techniques from control theory and machine learning to synthesize controllers that
  achieve safety in the presence of measurement model uncertainty. We define the notion
  of a Measurement-Robust Control Barrier Function (MR-CBF) as a tool for determining
  safe control inputs when facing measurement model uncertainty. Furthermore, MR-CBFs
  are used to inform sampling methodologies for learning-based perception systems
  and quantify tolerable error in the resulting learned models. We demonstrate the
  efficacy of MR-CBFs in achieving safety with measurement model uncertainty on a
  simulated Segway system.
