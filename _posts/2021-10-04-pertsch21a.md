title: Accelerating Reinforcement Learning with Learned Skill Priors
abstract: Intelligent agents rely heavily on prior experience when learning a new
  task, yet most modern reinforcement learning (RL) approaches learn every task from
  scratch. One approach for leveraging prior knowledge is to transfer skills learned
  on prior tasks to the new task. However, as the amount of prior experience increases,
  the number of transferable skills grows too, making it challenging to explore the
  full set of available skills during downstream learning. Yet, intuitively, not all
  skills should be explored with equal probability; for example information about
  the current state can hint which skills are promising to explore. In this work,
  we propose to implement this intuition by learning a prior over skills. We propose
  a deep latent variable model that jointly learns an embedding space of skills and
  the skill prior from offline agent experience. We then extend common maximum-entropy
  RL approaches to use skill priors to guide downstream learning. We validate our
  approach, SPiRL (Skill-Prior RL), on complex navigation and robotic manipulation
  tasks and show that learned skill priors are essential for effective skill transfer
  from rich datasets. Videos and code are available at https://clvrai.com/spirl.
