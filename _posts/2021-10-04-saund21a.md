title: Diverse Plausible Shape Completions from Ambiguous Depth Images
abstract: We propose PSSNet, a network architecture for generating diverse plausible
  3D reconstructions from a single 2.5D depth image. Existing methods tend to produce
  only small variations on a single shape, even when multiple shapes are consistent
  with an observation. To obtain diversity we alter a Variational Auto Encoder by
  providing a learned shape bounding box feature as side information during training.
  Since these features are known during training, we are able to add a supervised
  loss to the encoder and noiseless values to the decoder. To evaluate, we sample
  a set of completions from a network, construct a set of plausible shape matches
  for each test observation, and compare using our plausible diversity metric defined
  over sets of shapes. We perform experiments using Shapenet mugs and partially-occluded
  YCB objects and find that our method performs comparably in datasets with little
  ambiguity, and outperforms existing methods when many shapes plausibly fit an observed
  depth image. We demonstrate one use for PSSNet on a physical robot when grasping
  objects in occlusion and clutter.
