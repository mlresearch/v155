title: 'BayesRace: Learning to race autonomously using prior experience'
abstract: Autonomous race cars require perception, estimation, planning, and control
  modules which work together asynchronously while driving at the limit of a vehicle’s
  handling capability. A fundamental challenge encountered in designing these software
  components lies in predicting the vehicle’s future state (e.g. position, orientation,
  and speed) with high accuracy. The root cause is the difficulty in identifying vehicle
  model parameters that capture the effects of lateral tire slip. We present a model-based
  planning and control framework for autonomous racing that significantly reduces
  the effort required in system identification and control design. Our approach alleviates
  the gap induced by simulation-based controller design by learning from on-board
  sensor measurements. A major focus of this work is empirical, thus, we demonstrate
  our contributions by experiments on validated 1:43 and 1:10 scale autonomous racing
  simulations.
