title: Visual Localization and Mapping with Hybrid SFA
abstract: Visual localization is a crucial requirement in mobile robotics, field and
  service robotics, and self-driving cars. Recently, unsupervised learning with Slow
  Feature Analysis (SFA) has shown to produce spatial representations that enable
  localization from holistic images. The approach is faster and much less complex
  than state-of-the-art monocular visual SLAM methods while achieving similar localization
  performance in small-scale environments. However, the holistic approachâ€™s performance
  drops significantly for highly complex, large-scale environments due to scene variations
  occurring during a training phase. Instead of using holistic images, an alternative
  is to perform localization relative to unique regions present in a scene. Therefore,
  in this paper, we add a new component to the SFA localization pipeline that leverages
  state-of-the-art CNN to identify unique image regions. Hence we propose a hybrid
  approach that first learns such regions with a pre-trained CNN and then uses SFA
  for unsupervised pose estimation relative to each region. We present the experimental
  results from an autonomous robot in two different outdoor environments of varying
  complexity and size. The experiments show the proposed hybrid approach outperforms
  holistic SFA w.r.t localization accuracy in both environments, but benefits are
  more pronounced in the large-scale environment.
