title: 'DROGON: A Trajectory Prediction Model based on Intention-Conditioned Behavior
  Reasoning'
abstract: 'We propose a Deep RObust Goal-Oriented trajectory prediction Network (DROGON)
  for accurate vehicle trajectory prediction by considering behavioral intentions
  of vehicles in traffic scenes. Our main insight is that the behavior (i.e., motion)
  of drivers can be reasoned from their high level possible goals (i.e., intention)
  on the road. To succeed in such behavior reasoning, we build a conditional prediction
  model to forecast goal-oriented trajectories with the following stages: (i) relational
  inference where we encode relational interactions of vehicles using the perceptual
  context; (ii) intention estimation to compute the probability distributions of intentional
  goals based on the inferred relations; and (iii) behavior reasoning where we reason
  about the behaviors of vehicles as trajectories conditioned on the intentions. To
  this end, we extend the proposed framework to the pedestrian trajectory prediction
  task, showing the potential applicability toward general trajectory prediction.'
