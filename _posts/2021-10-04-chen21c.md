title: Learning Trajectories for Visual-Inertial System Calibration via Model-based
  Heuristic Deep Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Visual-inertial systems rely on precise calibrations of both camera intrinsics
  and inter-sensor extrinsics, which typically require manually performing complex
  motions in front of a calibration target. In this work we present a novel approach
  to obtain favorable trajectories for visual-inertial system calibration, using model-based
  deep reinforcement learning. Our key contribution is to model the calibration process
  as a Markov decision process and then use model-based deep reinforcement learning
  with particle swarm optimization to establish a sequence of calibration trajectories
  to be performed by a robot arm. Our experiments show that while maintaining similar
  or shorter path lengths, the trajectories generated by our learned policy result
  in lower calibration errors compared to random or handcrafted trajectories. The
  code is publicly available.
