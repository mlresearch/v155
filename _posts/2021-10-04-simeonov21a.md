title: A Long Horizon Planning Framework for Manipulating Rigid Pointcloud Objects
abstract: 'We present a framework for solving long-horizon planning problems involving
  manipulation of rigid objects that operates directly from a point-cloud observation.
  Our method plans in the space of object subgoals and frees the planner from reasoning
  about robot-object interaction dynamics. We show that for rigid-bodies, this abstraction
  can be realized using low-level manipulation skills that maintain sticking-contact
  with the object and represent subgoals as 3D transformations. To enable generalization
  to unseen objects and improve planning performance, we propose a novel way of representing
  subgoals for rigid-body manipulation and a graph-attention based neural network
  architecture for processing point-cloud inputs. We experimentally validate these
  choices using simulated and real-world experiments on the YuMi robot. Results demonstrate
  that our method can successfully manipulate new objects into target configurations
  requiring long-term planning. Overall, our framework realizes the best of the worlds
  of task-and-motion planning (TAMP) and learning-based approaches. Project website:
