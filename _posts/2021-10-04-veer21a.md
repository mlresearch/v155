title: Probably Approximately Correct Vision-Based Planning using Motion Primitives
abstract: 'This paper presents an approach for learning vision-based planners that
  provably generalize to novel environments (i.e., environments unseen during training).
  We leverage the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-Bayes framework to obtain an
  upper bound on the expected cost of policies across all environments. Minimizing
  the PAC-Bayes upper bound thus trains policies that are accompanied by a certificate
  of performance on novel environments. The training pipeline we propose provides
  strong generalization guarantees for deep neural network policies by (a) obtaining
  a good prior distribution on the space of policies using Evolutionary Strategies
  (ES) followed by (b) formulating the PAC-Bayes optimization as an efficiently-solvable
  parametric convex optimization problem. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
  for producing strong generalization guarantees for learned vision-based motion planners
  through two simulated examples: (1) an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigating
  obstacle fields with an onboard vision sensor, and (2) a dynamic quadrupedal robot
  traversing rough terrains with proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors.'
